"I took 2 bags of old clothes to the nearest recycling bin about a mile away.
When I got there, the bin wasn't there.
I had walked 20 minutes in the sweltering sun carrying these heavy bags for nothing.
The nearest suitable bin was now 2 miles away.
Then it hit me.
This must be what it's like being poor.
Two giant bags weighing you down.
Making your life harder.
Everything is slower and tougher.
This opened my eyes completely.
I dropped the bags then and there right in the street.
Why choose to be poor?
Simply drop the bags.",9h,454,53,0,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366452288661405700/
"I caught a thief stealing a package using my home security camera.
The police did nothing.
They said they don't deal with thefts of items with such low value.
What happened to society? I had the thief's face on camera and everything.
I decided to track the thief down myself.
Eventually after several months, I found him.
""I know you stole my trainers.""
The thief panicked. ""Please don't report me to the police.""
""I would never do that,"" I said. ""Instead, I have a job proposal for you. The website I bought the trainers from gave me replacement ones for free. I want to hire you to steal packages from outside my house every week. I will then sell the extra item and we split the profits.""
At first, he was sceptical, but even he could see this was a great offer.
Over the course of years, we made £5,000 in free replacement items together. Not only that, we got close, we bonded.
I gained a lot from this experience. Mainly, over 5 hours of footage of him stealing things from outside my house on a weekly basis.
That was ""high value"" enough for the police to put away this man for years.
When he tried to tell him the truth, they thought he was insane.
Never steal from a man who is willing to do anything for petty revenge.",d,3206,126,0,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365762234871939072/
"I went to the zoo today. Boring.
Animals are nowhere near as interesting as people, because they don't understand business.
Animals don't set up companies or hire and fire each other.
Animals don't attend conferences and host seminars.
Animals don't make CVs or list their strengths and weaknesses.
Animals don't have zoom meetings or know how to do an effective PowerPoint presentation.
Animals don't have sexual harassment lawsuits.
Animals don't plot and betray each other.
I can get all that amongst my staff.
There is nothing I gain from the zoo. It's for lesser minds who can't understand the nuance of office politics.
Yes, you might catch two animals fucking. But I can easily watch two humans do that too.
I have my own personal zoo. It's called my office window.
Don't go to the zoo. Go to work instead.",d,1044,79,0,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365338330223353856/
"I locked myself out of my house yesterday.
I had two zoom meetings with very important clients and a huge deadline looming.
I was in a panic.
Then, I realised something.
None of it matters.
Meetings. Deadlines. Shareholders. What do these things mean?
Are they really important to your being? Your soul?
If I miss these things, will my life end? Will I cease to exist?
None of it matters. It's all a game.
Suddenly, I was calm. Calm enough to call an Uber Exec to my second house.
I was early for my first meeting and they didn't even turn up.
They were locked out of their house too.
And they didn't have a second home.
It's all a game and I'm winning.",w,2382,86,0,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7363158577462558720/
"My mother was fined for using the Blackwall tunnel without paying the charge.
She found the payment system online confusing.
Her penalty kept increasing because she didn't see any e-mails about it.
It turned out she racked up £2,080 in fines.
I told her to not pay it. I told her to fight.
Yesterday, after 2 years of court appeals, she won.
She didn't have to pay any fines. All it took was £750 in legal fees and months of court appearances.
But that didn't matter.
What mattered was, she chose to fight.
Because she hired my law firm to fight it.
Kerching.

"I decide whether it's worth hiring a candidate based on just one question:
""Can you do a wheelie?""
Years ago when I was in school I asked my crush if she wanted to go to the dance.
She said no.
""Sorry I'm waiting for Todd to ask me. He can do 100 wheelies. I can't go to the dance with someone who can't do wheelies.""
Ever since then, I have decided who can do wheelies are vapid, showy and have a stupid face.
If a candidate says they can do a wheelie, I refuse to hire them.
Until yesterday, when a candidate walked in and proudly said he could do wheelies.
That candidate was Todd.
And I hired him, because it was time to be the bigger man.
I'm going to make Todd's life a living hell.",w,4588,155,0,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7359555431024795648/
"I have been neglecting my son.
Sometimes, it happens.
The late hours. The yacht parties. The trips overseas. More yacht parties. The networking events. Many many yacht parties.
I hadn’t seen my son for 14 months.
I had to do something about it.
That’s when I turned to
Lovable
.
Lovable is a platform that allows anyone of any skill level to build apps and websites using AI - I figured even a 6 year-old could use it.
I told him to build a replacement AI father.
It worked. I didn’t hear from him for another 3 months.
That’s when I started to miss him. I thought, “this is ridiculous.”
So I turned to Lovable and built an AI replacement son. Perfect.
We're closer than ever before.
Thank you
Lovable

"The radiologist called me yesterday.
It sounded serious.
They said they spotted an anomaly on my x-rays.
I was prepared for the worst.
They found a strange shape and the word ""Quantamonster.""
That's the company logo of my new startup.
Years ago I asked a surgeon to engrave it onto my patella.
Now, every time I go for an X-Ray, the radiologist sees it, gets intrigued.
If they search it, they'll find that we've just opened a new seed round. They sign up.

"An incident happened at work yesterday.
It involved me and an employee and potential toxic behaviour.
HR called me in to sign a declaration.
The declaration read:
""I, Ken Cheng, will always be a messy bitch.""
Problem solved.
The Messy Bitch Clause protects me from all legal ramifications from my chaotic actions.
Now, if anything comes up that looks like bullying, harassment, discrimination, people will say:
""No, it's not toxic. He's just a Messy B.""
""His intentions cannot be harmful. Messy B's can't intentionally cause harm.""
""He always throw staplers. That's classic Messy B behaviour.""
Phew.
I am safe to be my true self, and I will always endeavour to stay true to myself. By being the messiest bitch boss of all time.
Now I can't be sued for it.

"I listed a packet of ramen on FB Marketplace.
It was expired by 3 years 5 months.
It sold instantly.
Guess it's listing price.
£700.
How? Because no one else is selling expired ramen on there.
That's called a gap in the market.
Anything can be turned into a product - you just have to start selling it.
A good businessman listens to demand. A great businessman creates it.
It's the same with my LinkedIn. Nobody else is offering wisdom like me, and that's why it works.

"I'm sorry.
I have reached the 30,000 maximum limit of LinkedIn connections.
This is egregious.
Who is LinkedIn to say that I cannot have 30,001 deep spiritual bonds.
This is an absolute disgrace.
It reminds me of when I was sleeping with 30 women and they all found out. They responded fascistically, saying I couldn't do that.
Who is anyone to put a limit on who I connect my mind and flesh with?
Both LinkedIn and my many ex-girlfriends keep trying to police my relationships.
I'm sorry, but this means only one thing.

"I have been silenced.
This time it was not by traditional media. It was not by the woke left. Not by the theatre usher for saying ""bloody hell"" during Hamlet.
I have been silenced on the subreddit r/LinkedInLunatics.
A year ago my posts were featured on the front page every day. I didn't care that I was labelled a ""lunatic"", many greats were. As long as people saw my wisdom, civilisation was making progress.
At some point, I became too powerful. There were always three or four of my posts at the top.
This led to the invention of ""Satire Saturdays"", which resulted in the deletion of my posts not on a Saturday.
Here's the problem: my posts are not satire. Groundbreaking philosophy can sometimes feel like satire because it is so avant-garde and interesting.
What's next? I have to sit at the back of the bus because those are the ""Satire Seats""? My children have to go to the specific ""Satire School""? This is segregation at its finest.
UPDATE: The subreddit mods have requested that people do not harass them on the subreddit and I will echo that statement. While I wanted people to peacefully protest this ruling, it can very quickly veer into abuse and I do not want that.

"Rain sounds are actually fried chicken.
That's right.
Artificial rain noises are made by frying chicken.
That's the reality.
When learning this, a colleague said it took the romance out of rain sounds for them.
A weak response.
For me, it has added romance to the process of frying chicken.
Now, when I see fried chicken, I cannot help but think of love and lust.
Instead of chocolates, I give my lovers fried chicken.
I take them to KFC and insist on sitting within earshot of the kitchen.
When falling asleep in bed, I set off a deep-fat fryer as we doze off.
I almost burned down my house 3 times, but that's the price of knowing the truth.
For some, truth ruins the illusion. For me, it enhances it.

"Sad news, my journey at
TechChoice
has abruptly come to an end.
We all make mistakes, and one small mistake can cost you your entire job.
I was in the park showing my newborn baby to a bunch of strangers when something caught their eye.
Them: ""What's that Logo?"" Me: ""Oh, it's
TechChoice
.""
I had put the Techchoice logo on his nappies, his bib and given him a temporary Techchoice face tattoo.
Here's the twist: it wasn't my baby.
Some people asked me to watch their baby and I had ""borrowed"" him for a couple hours.
Simply, babies attract eyeballs. They are strong engagement generators.
The police eventually arrived, but I insisted I wasn't doing anything weird, I was merely using the infant for guerilla marketing.
They understood and let me off with a warning.
Unfortunately, Techchoice did not and said kidnapping isn't their company policy. I was let go.
Despite this, Techchoice is still #1 in my mind, and even though I may never know what it is they do, they have done something for me no other company has: let me get away with using recreational drugs.
Adios Techchoice.",mo,3207,200,0,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7354505708681207808/
"Bizarre first day at
TechChoice
.
When I arrived at reception, I was greeted by two guards standing in front of two doors, speaking in unison.
They asked me for my name and ID, and I asked if one of them only tells truths and one of them tells lies.
They had no idea what I was saying and insisted there was only one of them.
“Ah,” I said. “Both of you only tell lies then.”
After 2 hours, my boss came down to sort this out.
She insisted that I was hallucinating, possibly from the undercooked chicken I had this week.
I insisted that she was a vampire because I saw her floating across the lobby.
I told her to “prove it” by standing in front of a mirror. She stood next to the mirror next to the original guard (it was not two guards, he was just next to a mirror.)
I finally arrived at my desk 4 hours into the day, and I was no closer to figuring out what Techchoice does.
All I know is they love the “aaS” acronym as they deal in “UCaaS”, “DRaaS”, “IaaS”, “CCaaS”.
I tried to make a joke out of this and said “I’m an aaS-man too”, but it got no laughs because I was talking to a plant.
My boss said I should go home because I clearly had food poisoning.
Jokes on her as I had done shrooms that morning.

"Pleased to announce I have joined the company
TechChoice
as their new Social Media Manager.
They hired me to change the image of the company completely, ahead of their big rebrand.
Let me be honest: I still have no idea what they do.
Not one single idea.
When they were explaining what they do, I started to zone out and think about the roast chicken I’m having later.
If I had to guess, it was something to do with IT solutions, lemon and a small bunch of thyme.
It was all a blur and my boss only stopped talking when she noticed me salivating at the mouth a bit.
I was still thinking about the chicken.
But I’m sure they’re a great company. The best company.
