"Starbucks finally banned me. The crime? Turning their stores into my personal call centers. Baristas complained about my `aggressive phone presence.` I explained that their weak lavender lattes could never match the intensity of my coffee - which is just a proprietary blend of Allegra, Lexapro, and Ethiopian coffee beans. One sip and I can smell fear through the phone. I decided to set up my own coffee cart outside their corporate HQ. Called it `Grounds for Closing.` Every cup comes with a business card. Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol himself came down to shut me down. Not only did he leave with a $9 cup of coffee, but also a $5.4M software contract. Now Starbucks is my biggest client.

"I was cold calling during my nephew's baptism yesterday. The priest, while holding my nephew underwater, asked me to put my phone away. I said `Father, which is more holy? Dunking a baby in water or closing a $2.3M enterprise deal?` With my nephew still submerged, he had no answer. During the sermon, I closed three deals from the back pew. My commission that day? $185K. Granted, my comp plan’s windfall clause would net that out to about $28k but whatever. The collection plate though? $347. After the service, the priest pulled me aside. He wanted tips on converting more souls. I gave him my Objection Handling Masterclass for free. Turns out even God's salespeople need better training.

"Yesterday I did something I had never done in my baseball career: Hit a grand slam. I know what you’re thinking, “Really, Corp? With those thighs? You’re so cool and strong I bet you’ve hit 20 of em!” Yeah, no. I was a pitcher for most of my career. But here’s the real reason I’m posting this. I just had my first kiddo a month ago and this was his first game ever. Baseball is a huge part of my life even though I don't talk about it publicly too much. I’ve been playing on this same wood bat team for 10 years. Basically since I left independent minor league ball. It’s an 18+ adult league and now at the ripe age of 36, I feel old. “These kids, man!!!” This season I’ve started off in the tank. Perhaps it’s that the average age is 10-15 years my junior… Or maybe I’m just more tired these days from raising a small screaming potato. I’ve wondered if I’m washed up (obviously I am). But I just love it too much to quit. Still, I’m not used to not-dominating. Staring down the barrel of your athletic mortality is scary! Ask any athlete. The doubts had been creeping into my head. But then my wife Becca stepped in. “You need to hit mid-week if you want to keep up. I’ll go with you.” Now we go to the batting cages once a week for 30 minutes. She feeds the ball into the machine (4-seam grip of course) and BOOM… I get jammed by 78mph heaters lol. But yes, my 4-week post-partum wife gets in the batting cage with me and I smoke baseballs back at her. We do this every week now, while little-man gets Grandma time. Part of what made me so scared to have a kid was my fear that I would no longer be able to do the things that made me happy. Things like baseball. I was worried that my life would no longer be mine. And thanks to my wife, her family, and my family, that hasn’t been the case. I feel so fortunate to have such a strong support system around me. God knows I need it. I'm a prima donna. But, when I think about hitting that home run, I realize what made it special wasn’t the fact that it was worth 4 runs (though that was tight). It was because my support system was right there behind me: My wife and my son. I mean, literally, they shot the video above! But be it baseball or my weird/wild career path, they’ve always been behind me.",3m,1791,165,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/corporatebro?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAgDeQsBOjf1PW9WshszVGXT5gMsD6kYufU

"🎬 BIG NEWS:  `S.A.D. Sales Are Dope` is officially a MOVIE on Amazon! 🎉 Yes, you read that right. And no, it didn't happen overnight... Here’s the painfully honest, slightly embarrassing, and ultimately triumphant story of how S.A.D. (Sales Are Dope) went from a silly social media sketch to... Well, a movie on Amazon. 2013 - Posted first ever Corp Bro video 2017 - Coined the acronym S.A.D.N.E.S.S. (Sales Are Dope Never Ever Stop Selling) and started writing a Corporate Bro TV pilot 2019 - Shot the self-financed pilot down in LA - It was SO BAD. Fun fact: We fired our director after day 1 and also somehow* cast literal porn-stars as extras… Early 2020 - Released the pilot during the heart of the pandemic via a Youtube premiere with 3,000 people watching it together virtually. 2020-2021 - Wrote and wrote and wrote and finally finished a fully reworked season of SAD 2022 - Raised/financed ~$500k and shot the 8 episode web series (shoutout Bravado & Scratchpad ) 2023 - Released the full series on Youtube and hosted a premiere in SF 2024 - Amazon asked if we’d considered a film-cut version of SAD (luckily we had) 2025 - SAD gets picked up on Amazon as a movie! Here's the thing. We never did this for money (SAD is still deep in the red). We never even had a proper marketing plan (oops). We just had this need in our souls to create something authentic about the insanity and pain of working in Sales. And while we didn't make the next Office Space or Glengarry Glen Ross, we made SOMETHING. And now? It's a real movie. Still feels surreal typing that. To everyone who supported this journey, many of you right here on Linkedin- appreciate ya. To Ben who's been there since day one - couldn’t have done it without you. Biggest lesson? Don't wait for permission. Don't wait for perfect conditions. Just make the thing you want to make. Because sometimes that one-minute video turns into a movie on Amazon. 🎬 `S.A.D.

"Yesterday I found myself back Stanford University Graduate School of Business 's campus —not as the anxiety-ridden student I once was, but as the battle-scarred entertainment veteran I've become. 🎓⚡ When I sat in those seats years ago, I secretly wondered if I'd ever be `good enough` to be invited back. Would my experience be considered worth sharing with students? I wasn't going to be the startup founder with a billion dollar idea, and I certainly wasn't going to be the executive of some publicly traded company. Our panel topic? `The business of creative.` My unofficial subtitle: `How to endure creative heartbreak and still show up tomorrow.` The truth bombs we dropped that weren't in the brochure: --Every idea/project/concept you have becomes sell-job first. --That project you're passionate about? Expect to fight for it for YEARS. --Your brilliant idea will be murdered by millions of anonymous online opinions. --The most successful people aren't necessarily the most talented—they're the ones who refused to quit after failure number 89. KEEP WRITING. Watching those polished MBA faces absorb the unfiltered reality of our industry was both terrifying and deeply satisfying. Some looked horrified. Others leaned in. And some will go back to McKinsey. The entertainment business remains the most tumultuous, heartbreaking, and inexplicably rewarding career path I've ever encountered. It's a constant cycle of `I'm not good enough` followed by `Maybe I am` followed by `I definitely am not`—on endless repeat. Yet here I was, standing where I once sat, proof that surviving the chaos eventually becomes its own kind of credential. At this point in my career I've spoken in front of tens of thousands of people. But no SKO or conference feels quite like getting to go back to your alma mater -- this time facing the student instead of being one.

"Even if you're not a basketball fan, you probably heard that Luka Doncic was traded for Anthony Davis this past weekend. But just in case you're not grasping the impact of the most shocking trade in NBA history, I'll break it down for you in terms you'll understand: 1. Apple trades Steve Jobs to Microsoft in his prime for John Sculley. A more established but injury-prone executive with a proven championship pedigree. We all saw how that turned out. 2. China trades DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng for whoever the CEO of IBM is. This isn't happening, but can you imagine? 3. Suckle trades Corporate Bro - a young, sexy, top-performing account executive with limitless potential - to Beej for a mid-level manager whose best deals are behind him. Too unrealistic for a Season 2 subplot. `The future to me is 3-4 years from now. 10 years from now, they'll probably bury me by then.` That's the forward-level thinking of Dallas Mavericks GM Nico Harrison.

"DeepSeek ROCKED Nvidia and the AI markets yesterday... and now everything's back to normal? Maybe because a record number of small investors (including ya boi, even though I consider myself a big, jacked investor. This is NOT financial advice!) bought the Nvidia dip after the company lost $600B in market cap. The largest single day loss for a U.S. company in history. The fact that some people don't even believe DeepSeek's claims of their revolutionary AI models are true makes me think that the tremors of this advancement in AI technology is only beginning. After all, it's Open Source and anyone can see how they do it. Does this mean that the tech giants like Meta and Microsoft don't have to pay as much on AI infrastructure to get ahead?

To make the world we live in a little more palatable and happy. Even, or especially, when things are hard. That being said, if you want to stay serious for a second and help wildfire victims, Brea Burkholz - a spokesperson for Direct Relief, a California-based nonprofit that provides medical resources for disaster recovery - says “If you can make a direct connection to a family who is in need, that is a much better approach, because you know exactly who it’s going to and there’s a place for it.” But if you’re still looking for ways to support the fire victims, check out this resource provided by LAist.

"New Year's Resolutions are like sales forecasts. Go big and hope everyone forgets what you committed to. Thankfully, I'm heading into 2025 fresh off an unplugged, family vacation in Hawaii. There is not a more beautiful place to be sick as a friggin dog for the week... unfortunately, kind of takes the paradise out of the place. Anyways back to being healthy just in time for CES with Lenovo in Vegas - lucky me! With the new year, it feels like it’s the right time to announce the new and improved moi. I’ve been working with the great team over at NoBoringDesign on a brand refresh that I'm excited to share with all of you. From my website to my icons across all platforms, you’ll see we’ve taken the Corp universe to the next level. Let's start off this year by getting our brains big as heck. Here's...

"2024 recap post (+2025 sneak peak) coming to you from the beach in Hawaii. The start of a new year always feels like a great opportunity to look back and reflect. So with a Paper Crane (cocktail) in hand and waves rolling in, I've sat my juicy cheeks down to reflect on 2024. My first thought? What an epic year, and how damn grateful I am to be “Corp”.  So let me start this reflection with a genuine shout-out to all of you - my sales savages and Linkedin homies. Everyone who has smashed that like-button or shared a post of mine – Y’all are truly the best and I appreciate you. Next thought? I ACTUALLY achieved some of my 2024 goals. The same goals I wrote on stupid little post-it notes. This biggest one being that I got to appear in a global TV ad during the Olympics with the legendary Matthew McConaughey. Shoutout to Ashlyn and Marissa at Salesforce for making that happen. I also got to act alongside The Office legend Andy Buckley and Microsoft Sales Queen Deb Cupp . They say don’t meet your heroes, but Andy & Deb were some of the most down to earth people I’ve ever met! Speaking of memorable 2024 partners - I’m grateful to the 50+ brand partners that hired your boy this year.  Special shout out to Lenovo ’s team ( Hollyn Phelps ) and the crews over at Runway , Engine and Docusign . Love the creative energy you bring to the table. Then there was the Demoted Podcast . Natalie and I wanted to create a new show around honest, unfiltered workplace discussion. Our goal was 40 episodes and we published 47! We hit over a million listens and are fired up to start bringing on guests in 2025! Oh, we also hosted our first live show with Henry Schuck and ZoomInfo . On the personal side, I went to Portugal with my wife, Becca. We hadn’t taken a true vacation in several years and so spending 10 days roaming around Portugal was the perfect opportunity to reset and step away from the content game. Side note: Portugal is my new favorite country and I have tons of recs if you want them. Lastly, I really wanted to do a brand refresh both for myself and Corporate Bro. I work on so many random projects (Sales Are Dope Movie, Corp Capital , Corp Classic, Silly Valley News etc.) and I was having a really hard time unifying them on a brand level. Enter Eli Rubel and the team at NoBoringDesign . Together we spent the last 5 months working together on a new and improved Ross + Corporate Bro brand unification project. It was a long and difficult process because we needed to get it right – and they certainly got it right. So if you see new banners, new logos, new colors and a whole brand new website, and you’re like “woah Corp, that’s friggin’ sweet! Who did that?!” Well folks, it was NoBoringDesign . So yeah, hashtag # NewYearNewMe . Happy 2025 everyone. Hope you all hit quota and that all your dreams come true. I’d say “THIS IS OUR YEAR!” but last time I said that it had just turned to 2020… So yeah, I’ll avoid saying that for now. Everyone is back at zero.

"I just saw the most amazing play that I think is gonna be a huge hit. It's called `Hamilton.` Not only is the director Lin Manuel Miranda destined for greatness, but Leslie Odom Jr. is a rare, jazz-singing talent that deserves all the recognition in the world. I get it, `plays are so last century` or whatever and maybe I'm getting ahead of myself here. But this is already my second time seeing it and I was even more blown away this time around. Just my two cents, but I'd keep an eye out for this one breaking into the mainstream. Plus, sitting in a theater makes you hella cultured so I also have that going for me now.

"Most of you know me as Corporate Bro - the guy who roasts office culture and tries to make corporate life at least moderately more tolerable. And while yes, I’m still that guy, sometimes my creative energy gets spent on other ideas (wild, right?) For the past few months, myself and Stephen Ohl (Director of my series S.A.D.) have been quietly working on something - a feature film. It's called 'The Back 9' - a dark comedy that explores what happens when ambition, greed, and golf collide at a Florida country club in 1989. Think “The Hangover” meets ‘Weekend Bernie’s”, with a dash of the ‘Pulp Fiction’ creative spirit. I'm sharing this not because it's done (well, the script is), but because like I did with S.A.D., I believe in speaking things into existence. It also holds me accountable. We're aiming to create something that brings back the spirit of those R-rated comedies that used to keep your mom up at night worrying about your media consumption. As of now, we’re in search of a Producer. We’ve talked with several of the big agencies and while they love it, they’re slow. Too slow for me. And if I’ve learned anything from a life of sales, nothing gets done unless you make it happen. So that’s what I’m gonna do. If you’re interested in the project/script feel free to holler. Otherwise, stay tuned. Hopefully we can get it done in the next 2 years.

"Yesterday I got the opportunity to speak at ADWEEK ’s Brandweek conference in Arizona to discuss how brands can best partner with creators as well as the future of creators on Linkedin (spoiler: I'm bullish). I was joined on stage by Tyrona (Ty) Heath (Linkedin B2B Institute), Brendan Gahan (Founder Creator Authority ), and Jasmine Enberg (VP AT EMARKETER ). Here are a few tidbits I shared for brands looking to work with creators: Green Flags: 🟢🟢When a brand wants to partner with you because they consume your content and understand your POV -- not solely because of your audience demographics. Believe me, creators can tell. 🟢🟢Brands that look for long-term partnerships. Of course I do one-offs. But, I take great pride in trying to understand the businesses I work with. Not just the products but the stakeholders too. Also, being embedded with a brand opens up the door for many different types of creative activations (not just social media videos). See ClickUp as a great example. Red Flags: 🚩🚩Brands that require too much product marketing language in videos. Believe me, no one givesAF about your “scalable cloud solution that enables the future of work through AI and machine learning.” Let creators show and not tell. This tends to happen when too many stakeholders get involved. These videos perform worse 100% of the time. 🚩🚩Brands who will take 3 weeks to deliver feedback and then expect a 24-hour turn around. Dear brands, creators are running a business too. We have content calendars, other partnerships, and obligations. Let's respect each other's time ;). Content partnerships have the potential to be creative, engaging, and deliver results when creators and brands understand one another.

"Should you get your MBA or not? Today, LinkedIn dropped their business school rankings and I admit, I didn’t realize there were other business schools as I’ve never had to scroll past the top spot. Teehee. I’m kidding. But seriously, the debate on whether or not an MBA is worth your time/money is a big one. I’ll start with saying it’s a massive privilege to be able to attend graduate school. If you’re doing a full-time MBA it’s two years and it’s very hard to have a full-time job at the same time. Do you need an MBA? Absolutely not. For my salesfolk out there, the MBA could not be less necessary for career advancement. If you can sell, you can sell. Period. There’s no need to go unless you are considering a pivot out of sales. However, speaking for myself, getting my MBA opened up a ton of opportunities. I was the only salesperson at the school during my two years. After graduation, a lot of my classmates went on to start companies of their own. Suddenly, sales became very very important to them. Who did they call? They called me. I also believe gaining a better understanding of the overall business ecosystem is never a bad thing. How to read a balance sheet, understanding how equity works, how VC works, the process of founding a startup and taking it to IPO... More knowledge makes you more dangerous in your role, regardless of what you do. Again, more of a nice-to-have than a need to have. Last thing I’ll say because this is way too much text… The most valuable thing I got from business school was the opportunity to be around extremely smart, driven, and ambitious people. They say you are the average of the people you hang out with. Being around so many impressive people made me want to achieve more, and work harder. I felt inspired and compelled to try and do more. To figure things out. Of course many of them are now lifelong friends. For me, getting my MBA was one of the most transformative things I’ve ever done. If you want a more in-depth look at the value of an MBA check out the Demoted Podcast episode where Natalie and I discuss: https://lnkd.in/dBFfNAvK",11m,588,58,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/corporatebro?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAgDeQsBOjf1PW9WshszVGXT5gMsD6kYufU

"Me? In a Salesforce tv ad? During the Olympics? It's true. When Salesforce asked me if I would be cool letting Matthew McConaughey be in their commercial with me I admit I wasn’t totally sure. How could a guy, who had probably never updated Salesforce before, possibly hang with someone like me (who has updated Salesforce no less than a million times)? I said to myself, “You know what? Sometimes you gotta let other people shine.” After all, this could be his big break. That’s when I pitched the idea for him to take every single line and be the star. I know, I know, “how thoughtful of me.” But it wasn’t totally altruistic. I felt it was best for me and my career to deliver the single greatest 1 second *nervous face* the world has ever seen. I did 1 take. It was all they needed. The director wept tears of joy and several people admitted to getting goosebumps. Whatever. Story of my life. Bottom line, I don’t want to be portrayed as a hero. I’m not. I just saw so much talent in a young man named Mathew McConaughey, I was compelled to share him with the world.

"I'm not one for LinkedIn profile updates, but this one is a little different for me. I'm stoked to join Salesfinity as an advisor. I'm joining not just because they have an awesome product, but I'm so impressed by the human behind it: Mavlonbek . If you don't know Mav, his story is wild. Studied law in Uzbekistan, realized it wasn't for him. Decided to take English classes and discovered the Silicon Valley. Saved some money to come study in the US. To pay tuition he sold fidget spinners on Amazon. During COVID he started making Russian honey cakes (Medovik) out of his apartment in SF. He sold them through DoorDash and UberEats to make ends meet. Low-key built a honey cake empire. After graduating he decided to start a software company (classic move from honey cakes to Saas).  It was an AI Writing Assistant for marketers, which was acquired. From his challenges in Biz Dev he started Salesfinity in 2022.  So yes, I'm honored to work with a true sales savage.

"Dream of acting alongside Matthew McConaughey? CHECK. This is kind of a wild story. As many of you who have followed me for years already know, I’ve had some strong back and forth banter with Salesforce over the years. It started in 2013 when they turned me down for an SDR role (which is how I ended up at Oracle). Totally not bitter. But fast forward 10+ years, hundreds of videos later, and I find myself part of their national ad campaign. Siiick! But, this isn’t your typical ad campaign. While Matthew McConoghey portrays protagonist and sheriff (duh), they still needed a foil. An outlaw. Someone who could play the villain. And that of course, is where I came in. So, we decided to develop the character from the TV Ad and create a social campaign. Together with Ted Harrison from neuemotion and Joel Wheat from Salesforce, we built a backstory behind the Silicon Valley Data Thief. The Data Desperado. The “cow-bro,” if you will. It’s very rare to see companies (especially B2B) do large-scale world-building. It was such a large undertaking with so many creative minds and moving pieces. Shoutout to Marissa Kraines , Kim B., Ashlyn Remillard , & Hailey Woram . Over the next few months you’ll see videos set in the A.I. Wild West that are all part of this broader campaign. They’re going to be less social media-y and a bit more cinematic. Just remember next time you’re watching TV to keep an eye out for the guy rocking leopard print under the green vest. Proud to be a part of this! Now for the first video of the social campaign: “Wanted.”",1y,1377,109,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/corporatebro?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAgDeQsBOjf1PW9WshszVGXT5gMsD6kYufU

Today we’re dropping our 🚨2024 Revenue Recap!🚨 While it’s called a recap it really looks forward into the signals we’re seeing for 2024. And the good news is, for the first time in a while… It’s good news!🫶🏻 A few notable highlights: -Since December 2023, VC funding has been accelerating. 📈 -Valuations are up, from early to late-stage 📈 -83% of companies are planning to grow Sales headcount in 2024 -63% of sales teams are currently hiring for sales roles -There seems to be a refocus on growth (versus profitability) -The layoff contagion is FINALLY beginning to slow. 🙌🏻 What this means: Finally we’re seeing some some light at the end of the tunnel. Let be real, Tech will never be the way it was 10 years ago. How could it be? It was silly, unsustainable, unjustifiable. There was a required recalibration. But luckily the worst appears behind us. We’re seeing companies ramp up hiring again. Sales leaders are more optimistic and the market seems to be responding in kind.If you’re interested in the full report, you know where to find it. 👇👇 corp",1y,433,23,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/corporatebro?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAgDeQsBOjf1PW9WshszVGXT5gMsD6kYufU

"`Corp how do you write your comedy sketches?` Here's a short breakdown: 1) I always think of Corp Bro in the 3rd person... So first, I come up with a 1 sentence description of the video. It could be `Corp has a rough sales call` or `Corp closes a deal.` In this case we'll use `Corp finds a lucky penny.` 2) Next is figuring out `The Game.` The Game is the main joke or structure that runs through the whole sketch. There are tons of games that can be used and I'll make a separate post about that later. Examples include Parody, Escalation, Topical, Status flip etc. For this video we'll use `Frustration.` 3) Ok so how do we link finding a lucky penny to frustration? Well, what if the penny isn't actually lucky? Maybe it's an unlucky penny. Okay great, so now lets pick 3 unlucky things that happen to Corp? -Coffee machine is broken -Computer freezes -Loses a big deal Now we've included the `rule of 3s` as well as Escalation. All we need is a final scene. 4) Lastly we need to think about `The Button.`  The Button is final line of a sketch. It should not only resolve the sketch and be funny, but place a “pretty bow” on it. With this video, we'll have Corp launch the penny into the ocean... Why? Because screw that penny. But also, to add one more joke, we'll have Corp throw out his arm because he's a washed up athlete.

"My dearest of Sales Savages, it is with great honor that I present to you the official trailer of S.A.D. (Sales are Dope). On April 13th, 2023 the entire 8-episode series will be streaming on Youtube. Episodes are short. They range between 8 and 17 minutes. The entire season is 91.5 minutes of run time so in theory, you could/should watch it in one sitting. I’d even recommend it. While some of the characters will return from the pilot we shot back in 2019, this is a completely new story in a completely new world. It follows the west coast Sales team for a Series-A startup called Suckle. If you want to know what Suckle does you’ll have to ask Raj because I have no idea. It’s a product of several years of work and so many people - including the folks at Bravado and Scratchpad . Without them, and yeah some of their money, we would never have been actually able to make this damn thing. So muchas gracias to both of them! You’ll notice the quality difference immediately (compared to 2019). This was done in such a way, that from a technical standpoint, it could go live on Netflix tomorrow. And while that’s the long term hope, all we really want to do is prove we deserve to make a second season. So on April 13th, I hope you’ll give it a watch. Sales Are Dope.

"For every sales savage with a quota and a dream... this one's for you. Three years ago Ben and I wrote and shot a TV pilot (it's on Youtube) that could only be described as “a masterclass in mediocrity.” So we went back to the writers’ room… and cooked up something new. 3 years later, after tons of my sweat and Ben 's blood and tears, we finally finished writing our 8-episode mini series called S.A.D. (Sales are Dope). It follows the West Team at a chaotic series-A startup called Suckle. While it’s completely separate from the previous pilot, you’ll still see some of the characters you know and love. Filming started yesterday in LA and will continue through mid-august in SF. We have an amazing cast (including Natalie (Corporate Natalie) ; even good ol’ Raj) and an awesome production team of some of Hollywood’s best. This project has been, and still is, a massive undertaking. While each day we have ~30 people on set to support us we would have never gotten this far without two leaders in the Sales Community: Sahil Mansuri of Bravado and Pouyan Salehi of Scratchpad . Since day 1 they've shared in the vision to elevate the profession of Sales. Without them, this project would have remained dream. To us, both companies are staples of the modern sales experience - which is exactly the story we’re trying to tell. I know some of you have followed this journey since 2014 when our videos were 6 seconds long. You’ve seen the growth. You’ve seen the bootstrapped operation we run. While I can’t promise it will be the next Office (I can actually promise you it won’t be), it will most certainly be a style of its own. This one is for the Sales Savages. The cold callers. The unsolicitors. This one is for the revenue drivers. The SDRs slumlords. The purveyors of SADNESS. Whether you’ve been following us since day 1 or since yesterday, this series would not exist without you. Okay, now that you’re emotional and in the spirit of our beautiful profession I’m going to ask for something... it’s money.

"Story time: My first sales job (unpaid internship) was in 8th grade. I sold salad dressing and croutons for my aunt. Dressed in a suit, I'd go into fancy grocery stores and whip up mini salads for patrons to try. I wasn't allowed to leave until all dressings were sold. Given I only did this on weekends, you bet I was trying to slang 'em as quickly as possible. I absolutely slayed with the over-50 and recently divorced crowd. After all, I’m pretty sure salads are the national food of the self-loathing. I learned a lot about rejection in that job. I once got b!tched out for not knowing the expiration date of the blue cheese. I was scolded for not knowing what gluten intolerance was. One guy even made a comment about “getting high on my own supply” when he saw me eat a crouton that had fallen out of my bowl. I wouldn’t even know what that phrase meant until college – at my next sales job. The one not on my resume. Suffice to say some people just don’t want what you’re selling. Turns out not everyone is in the market for creamy salad dressings made with all natural ingredients. There are no silver bullets in sales. And despite some of my less-than-stellar interactions with customers, I was determined not to let my spirit break. Because the only thing I’d allow to be broken on those long Saturdays…. Were child labor laws. hashtag # CareerKickstart 💼 hashtag # Sales",3y,2060,79,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/corporatebro?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAgDeQsBOjf1PW9WshszVGXT5gMsD6kYufU

"This week I performed my first live show in nearly two years. I had no idea walking out of Dropbox ’s SKO in Feb of 2020 that the next time I’d step on a stage in front of a live audience that the world would look so vastly different. People often ask me if the pandemic ruined my opportunities to speak. In short, no, it actually helped. Over the last 18 months I’ve had the opportunity to speak to almost 200 organizations - all virtually. And while I’m extremely thankful for those opportunities, it wasn’t the same. Performing comedy virtually is tough. I’m not gonna lie. With microphones muted, you have no idea if your jokes are landing. You have no idea if anyone is listening. You miss the crowd vibe and the opportunity to improv. All I could do was hope for feedback. A DM here, a thank you note there. When ClickUp asked me to speak at their SKO in San Diego the answer was an emphatic yes. But excitement quickly turned to nerves. I get nervous, people. Like, really fking nervous. I didn’t sleep for weeks. Why? Because public speaking is scary. And when people are expecting you to make them laugh, it’s even scarier. If I did bomb, what’s there to lose? Oh right, my dignity, my confidence, my entire mental well-being. Just that. But I’m not in the business of letting people down. So I prepared. I wrote, rewrote, and rewrote some more. I decided to test some of the material I had been using for my virtual gigs. Everyday for several hours I would perform in my living room. I’d make eye contact with each pillow on my couch. I’d pretend the chairs were people (they never laughed once btw). I’d put on loud music as a distraction to make sure I could maintain focus. I’ll never not be prepared. And while I’ve had many companies cancel gigs on me because I have the word “bro” in my name. And while I’ve had people judge me, DM me hate messages, try to cancel me and drag me because of a poorly-aged stage name or edgy content, all that matters is that I stay true to my ‘why.’ My why is S.A.D.N.E.S.S. It’s the quota carriers. The sales savages in the trenches. It’s for the people whose livelihoods are built around a nearly arbitrary number. Being in-person with them. There is no substitute. And for them I am eternally grateful. Now, back to the funny sh!t.

Or even land a higher OTE in your next role. STOP VALUING YOURSELF BY YOUR LAST QUARTER. Seriously. It's bullshit we are taught to think that way. You have a body of work. You have a career. You have a track record. REP THAT SHIT.

Whether you’re an SDR, or CRO. Slang SaaS or Medical Devices, the War Room is designed to reward those who do it best. Think exclusive job opportunities, additional ways to make money, and most importantly, a place to learn from and network with the best in the biz.

"This is an open letter to anyone and everyone who is thinking about publicly criticizing salespeople. Do yourself a favor: Shut up. Over the last few months, I have seen A TON of posts openly ripping the profession of sales. You know the first thing I do when I see public criticism of salespeople? I check the poster’s work experience. And let me be clear: If you want to publicly criticize salespeople without having ever done this job? Shut up. If you take a second to look at YOUR OWN sales team you might have a little perspective. Sales is HARD, people. IT’S SO HARD. That’s probably why YOU don’t do it. Cold calls are scary. You are putting yourself out there. Your entire professional life is getting rejected while searching tirelessly for those wins big and small. THAT’S WHY we get PAID. Don’t get me wrong, there are A LOT of BAD salespeople. Who use bad tactics. Who should also: SHUT UP. But please, realize many of the cold-callers out there are early in their careers and trying to learn. There IS a HUMAN on the other end of those calls.

"Friends of Linkedin! I am so very proud to announce that one week from today (July 8th), I will be dropping the first episode of a webshow I’ve been working on in conjunction with Bravado . With COVID stalling efforts to create a full sitcom, we decided to pivot to a sketch/talk-show style. We’ve been writing, scheming, and filming for months now. Most of it has been shot in my apartment in San Francisco which you will see. Episodes will be posted on Youtube and on Bravado. I hope you’ll subscribe to the Youtube (i’ll link it in the comments) and tune in next week! Special thanks to Sahil Mansuri for giving me a shot.",5y,326,22,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/corporatebro?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAgDeQsBOjf1PW9WshszVGXT5gMsD6kYufU
"Yesterday I officially graduated from Stanford University Graduate School of Business. I am honored to have spent time with some of the most intelligent, accomplished, and humble people in the universe. I cannot believe it's over. All I can say is that I am proud of my classmates (The Class of 2020). One day I'll get to say, `Yeah, I shotgunned a beer with ______ and now they are a world-leader.` To be honest I had many moments of doubt. That's what happens when you're around the caliber of people at Stanford. But I leave now more optimistic and more grateful than I have ever been. It's rare to be a sales-guy in business school and a shock that I passed (barely) accounting class. But ultimately, my decision to attend GSB was the best one I've ever made. Thank you to everyone who supported me along the way. Oh, and with my business degree, I've decided to pursue comedy. OOPS. Sorry mom and dad. The world needs laughter now more than ever.
