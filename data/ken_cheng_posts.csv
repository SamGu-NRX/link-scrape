"I took 2 bags of old clothes to the nearest recycling bin about a mile away. When I got there, the bin wasn't there. I had walked 20 minutes in the sweltering sun carrying these heavy bags for nothing. The nearest suitable bin was now 2 miles away. Then it hit me. This must be what it's like being poor. Two giant bags weighing you down. Making your life harder. Everything is slower and tougher. This opened my eyes completely. I dropped the bags then and there right in the street. Why choose to be poor? Simply drop the bags.",10h,464,53,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"I decide whether it's worth hiring a candidate based on just one question: `Can you do a wheelie?` Years ago when I was in school I asked my crush if she wanted to go to the dance. She said no. `Sorry I'm waiting for Todd to ask me. He can do 100 wheelies. I can't go to the dance with someone who can't do wheelies.` Ever since then, I have decided who can do wheelies are vapid, showy and have a stupid face. If a candidate says they can do a wheelie, I refuse to hire them. Until yesterday, when a candidate walked in and proudly said he could do wheelies. That candidate was Todd. And I hired him, because it was time to be the bigger man. I'm going to make Todd's life a living hell.",2w,4590,155,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"I have been neglecting my son. Sometimes, it happens. The late hours. The yacht parties. The trips overseas. More yacht parties. The networking events. Many many yacht parties. I hadn’t seen my son for 14 months. I had to do something about it. That’s when I turned to Lovable . Lovable is a platform that allows anyone of any skill level to build apps and websites using AI - I figured even a 6 year-old could use it. I told him to build a replacement AI father. It worked. I didn’t hear from him for another 3 months. That’s when I started to miss him. I thought, “this is ridiculous.” So I turned to Lovable and built an AI replacement son. Perfect. We're closer than ever before. Thank you Lovable , for giving us the father-son relationship we never had.",2w,4859,138,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc

They found a strange shape and the word `Quantamonster.` That's the company logo of my new startup. Years ago I asked a surgeon to engrave it onto my patella. Now, every time I go for an X-Ray, the radiologist sees it, gets intrigued. If they search it, they'll find that we've just opened a new seed round. They sign up.

Now, if anything comes up that looks like bullying, harassment, discrimination, people will say: `No, it's not toxic. He's just a Messy B.` `His intentions cannot be harmful. Messy B's can't intentionally cause harm.` `He always throw staplers. That's classic Messy B behaviour.` Phew. I am safe to be my true self, and I will always endeavour to stay true to myself.

"I have been silenced. This time it was not by traditional media. It was not by the woke left. Not by the theatre usher for saying `bloody hell` during Hamlet. I have been silenced on the subreddit r/LinkedInLunatics. A year ago my posts were featured on the front page every day. I didn't care that I was labelled a `lunatic`, many greats were. As long as people saw my wisdom, civilisation was making progress. At some point, I became too powerful. There were always three or four of my posts at the top. This led to the invention of `Satire Saturdays`, which resulted in the deletion of my posts not on a Saturday. Here's the problem: my posts are not satire. Groundbreaking philosophy can sometimes feel like satire because it is so avant-garde and interesting. What's next? I have to sit at the back of the bus because those are the `Satire Seats`? My children have to go to the specific `Satire School`? This is segregation at its finest. UPDATE: The subreddit mods have requested that people do not harass them on the subreddit and I will echo that statement.

"Happy Valentine's Day to my latest beau. Took pictures of her at work to commemorate. Yes, work. Yes, she is one of my employees. Yes, I hired her because I wanted to date her. No, there is nothing wrong with that. Believe it or not, there is no such thing as a power imbalance. Because even though I have power in that I can fire her, she has power because she can break up with me, so we are equal. It's actually very sexist to assume she doesn't have any power just because I decide her salary and make her do what I want at any time. Power imbalance implies weakness. She is not weak.

"Followers on LinkedIn, I need to say a few words. I would like to make a sincere apology for my previous post, advertising an event I am hosting and claiming that I will `literally die` if it doesn't sell out. The truth is: that was a lie. This was a heat of the moment lapse of judgement and I am sorry to those hurt by this. Lying to people in order to make a quick profit is something that goes against my values and something a CEO would never do. I did what I did for one simple reason alone. My family has been kidnapped by terrorists and they told me I had to make that post. It felt horrible though. It was not me. In the coming months, I am going to seek therapy and practice a lot of self reflection. After that, I will be absolved of all sins that `pre-therapy Ken` did because it was a completely different person.

"My 9 year old son is getting bullied at school. Most parents would step in and get involved themselves. Not me. I referred him to an LLM.

The whole school were so impressed by his oratory skills he became popular overnight. This became an issue. He started refusing to do his homework. When I asked him to do chores he would hit me with another French Philosopher. Daniel started to think of himself a God. He had to be stopped. Did I turn to ChatGPT?

Since becoming a millionaire I struggle to connect with my poor friends. Why? I haven't changed. Why do they treat me differently? Because I have a fast car? Because my watch costs more than their yearly rent? Or is it because I like to dangle a £50 note above them and make them bark like a dog? I'm still the same human being. I still breathe the same air. I just like to tell them to go `woof woof` and beg in a little doggy voice. I don't understand. I think it's jealousy. Or a lack of empathy. If they were in my shoes they'd also make their friends roll over and behave like an animal for money. It's unfair. I've been ostracised just for my affectionate nature.

That's when I had it...`competitive salary.` We could picture it now. Applicants reading it and thinking `wow, this salary is COMPETITIVE. It's the Michael Phelps of salaries. My salary could beat up your salary.` It was perfect. It said so much while not committing to anything at all. When those golden words left my mouth, everyone in that room knew I had changed recruiting forever. I received a 3 minute standing ovation and I did six laps of high fives, then crowdsurfed out of there.",7m,2807,159,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"Rejection is painful. For the person doing the rejection as well as the person being rejected. It hurts me so much to tell someone I'm crushing their dreams. I feel like George in Of Mice and Men, taking Lennie out and shooting him in the back of the head. I feel like I'm taking a life. That's why as an employer I never send out a rejection email. No matter how many interviews they have, they will never see a formal rejection out of me. It's too painful. People call this `ghosting`. I call it `giving hope`. There is no better feeling than waiting to hear back from a job interview. That hopeful feeling of endless potential. I let people live with that hope forever.

"£10,000 or my book? I asked a random woman on the street which she would rather take. I fully expected her to say the money instead of a book that'll be available in regular stores for £15. She did say the £10,000. A huge mistake. Why? Inside my book I had hidden £50,000 in cash. By being greedy, this woman made a net loss of £40,000. The lesson?

In it was his passport, his birth certificate, £100k in cash and a 50-page document titled `How To Impersonate Me If I Die At Sea`. His name was Ken Cheng. I stole the real Ken Cheng's identity.

I hired you for a job and I only care about one thing: I'm allowed to completely exploit you and disregard your employment rights at any time.

Do I protect my reputation and move on? Would that be doing this man a disservice though? Everyone deserves a fifth chance. I had a solution. In the interview, I looked him in the eye and asked him to say “I will not do crime ever again.” He did. I then provided a picture of his mother and asked him to hold it and swear on her life. He did. Phew. I believed him. But I still needed to make sure. After he left, I tailgated him for several hours. I watched him go to the shops, pick up his children, then I parked outside his home for a bit and watched him watch Netflix until he got tired and got into bed with his wife.

The soup is trying to give you heat and warmth, but sometimes the soup will be too hot and it burns your mouth. That's not the soup's fault. You wouldn't call the soup toxic. The soup loves you, and was just trying to help keep you warm. It was you that burned yourself by not waiting for it to cool down. Similarly, your boss loves you and is simply trying to help you become more efficient with their management style. Sometimes that management style is too hot and will make you cry in the toilet. But other times, it will help you grow as a person. You need to be more patient with your boss, just like with your soup. It's you that's hurting yourself. You're the one who's toxic.

"`Strategies to avoid burnout.` `How to prevent burnout.` `Burnout is a killer.` No. Burnout is actually good. There are many great things that have been achieved because of intense burnout. Inventing the iPhone. Making Apocalypse Now. Winning World War II. The truth is, if you push past max burnout, the human brain resets, like getting a score so high on an arcade machine it wraps around to zero. This is called `burn-in`. Burn-in is a state of true enlightenment that can only be reached by not eating, sleeping or even drinking properly, and riding off pure adrenaline - that's what it's for. Scientifically, we have evolved to work past legal working hours. You sometimes hear people say `I worked so hard I have nothing left.` Good. It means you're maximising your potential. That's burn-in. This is why I push my workers to the edge. The stress they feel is only their brains being too afraid to succeed. They say that diamonds are made under pressure.

"Years ago, I committed corporate fraud. I almost got away with it, but I made one major mistake. I set my Out of Office reply to `brb doing some fraud`. This was a massive smoking gun. The authorities were right to be suspicious. When they investigated me, they were meticulous. They went through my entire social media which I thought I kept squeaky clean. But they found photos of my new shredder with the caption `can't wait to use this to erase important evidence`.

I was constricted by the immutable laws of StB. I had to kiss her. It ended up being a really good kiss. I shouldn't have written her off simply because it's heavily inappropriate to kiss your employees.

She later admitted she spent 2 hours every day practising her bottle spinning technique so she knew where it would land. I admired her persistence and promoted her. The lesson?

In 2006 I was running two companies at once, and one day I had to work 13 hours on both simultaneously.

"I am outraged to discover the little holes I carved into the toilet cubicles for employees to anonymously practise handshakes with each other are being misused for sex. Strong handshakes are very important for business. Some people have naturally limp handshakes and are ashamed about it. Enter my brilliant solution. A little hole between each pair of toilet cubicles where men and women can stick their hands through and work on their handshake without fear of repercussion. A perfect system. Or so I thought.

"I'm starting to think I'm too good at sex. I mean from a business perspective. Think about it, usually if you are good at something you can easily monetise it. If you are a good plumber, you can up your rates. If you are a good accountant you can ask for a raise. I cannot charge people for having sex with me (very often), despite having improved my sex game loads by using Wikihow and rewatching Basic Instinct over and over again with a notepad. This means every time I have sex I'm knowingly entering a bad business deal, and that's a huge mood killer for me. If I believe my sex is worth £500, then every one night stand is essentially me lighting £500 on fire. When I realised this, I thought I could never have sex again. Then I remembered something. Charity exists. I can treat this as charity work. Not only did I get to continue to selflessly have sex without charging people, I've always been meaning to start donating to charity too.

Both the bride and groom got really confused and the bride swore on her life she never met me before.

"`HOW IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR FATHER` This is the most important interview question I ask. Why? Because I only hire people with Daddy Issues. People with complicated relationships with their father are more productive workers. They desperately want approval from a male authority figure and will do whatever it takes to get it. It's important to replicate this familial relationship in the office. This is why in my office, I don't ask people to address me formally and call me `Sir`, `Mr Cheng.` Instead I make them call me `Daddy.` When they miss a deadline or screw up a sale, I tell them `Daddy is disappointed...` I can see that they genuinely feel they let me down and will work harder next time. Then I say `but Daddy still loves you.` Then they still feel the need to stay loyal. Treating your whole office like they're your 200 children is unorthodox, and even `gross` to some.

"A few years ago I felt like my employees weren't appreciating me. That's why I decided to fake my own death. It turns out it's a very hard to fake your own death legally. I didn't want to half-ass it, so after paying off a few police officers, a coroner, a judge and a Hollywood special effects team who could stage a fire in my own home, it was done. Now it was time to find out what people really thought of me. I would go into my old office disguised in overalls, a big thick moustache and a French accent, pretending to be a cleaner called Pierre, but very few people would be talking about me. I hadn't even told my wife I wasn't actually dead. That's when I found her cheating on me with one of the board members, Wilfred, who had also started trying to take over the company. This was devastating. I started to regret faking my death at all. But then, I realised something. I stopped getting people bothering me for things. I was no longer getting invited to Mark and Liz's fondue night. No one was asking me to attend their boring ass wedding in Dubai. I didn't have to pay £2,000 in library fines.

Later, in the green room I saw one of the Dragons tip a four full boxes of Celebrations chocolates into his bag and no one did anything. It was the same Dragon that invested in my company. I decided to say something. `Excuse me, you can't take these chocolates, they're for everyone.` `I'm a fucking dragon, I can do whatever I want.` The Dragon, who shall remain nameless, got extremely irate. `I didn't become the CEO of Bannatyne Health Club & Spa by being a coward.` We then got into a fist fight, which I won pretty easily thanks to watching Van Damme movies. However, my episode was cut from the show and the investment deal was withdrawn. I lost out on £200,000 for doing the right thing. Fast forward 20 years, I'm CEO now, sitting in a green room with four boxes of Celebrations in front of me. I now understood where that Dragon was coming from, and I tipped all four boxes worth into my bag: no one did a thing. It's very easy to judge a CEO before you've walked a mile in their shoes, but now I get it. Every single one of us would steal communal chocolates if we had the power to.

I was too attractive to be bumped. The flight attendant took me aside and said `sorry sir, I'll let you in on a secret. You're too hot to not be let on this plane. We only bump the ugliest passengers.` Very frustrating. I wasted all this money on a ticket AND I had to go see my stupid new child.

"It's true what they say: Gen Z are the most difficult generation to work with. They just do not respect authority the way their predecessors do, and that is a problem. Last month, during the staff training day, I set up an exercise that involved two employees. One was hooked up to an electric shock machine and the other had to administer increasing degrees of electric shocks without questioning why. Not a single Gen Z employee would administer the shocks, citing their `conscience` as the reason. Insanely frustrating. The software industry moves fast and sometimes you need your employee to electrocute someone without time for an explanation. What is happening to the world? How can I expect to run a business properly if my workers won't put aside their values on human rights to do exactly what I say at all times?

Many were sympathetic, laughed it off and said it was just a mistake and I'm only human. I even got a few DM slides from employees who were intrigued about my habits, but I decided to keep things professional at work by not replying until I was at home. However, one employee Geoff came in to tell me he found it a bit inappropriate that I had a porn tab open at work. I fired Geoff immediately. I find being judgemental of others' innocent mistakes to be a major red flag, and it was a perfect way to root that out. The twist? I pulled up that porn tab on purpose.

This annoyed me to no end (unlike the loss itself, which I was 100% cool with.) Beth's performance review was coming up.

Much more impressive. And I think I can do it. One day an alien will come to Earth seeking to destroy us. I will however sit down with that alien and formulate a business plan, where we can both mutually benefit. The alien would reconsider its decision to annihilate us and instead enter a corporate merger, uniting against our common enemy: the consumers. Sometimes business can feel like you're dealing with an alien but remember that there is one universal currency...fat stacks. I would then kiss the alien, like I do in all my business meetings.",11m,413,22,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"I have recently come under fire for having a 100% male upper management team. Thank you for raising this important issue. As a very successful CEO with a lot of followers, I am committed to hiring the best employees for certain jobs, regardless of gender. It just so happens that these are all men who are my best friends from university. The reality is that certain professions naturally have gender imbalances. For example, there are more CEOs called John than there are women. My conclusion is that there must be something particularly success-oriented about the name John, so I have hired a lot of people called John. It just so happens that these are all men who also went on my stag do. While I fully support the push for greater diversity in the workplace, the current ratio of male to female persons with the name John makes this very difficult. And hiring people named John is something I'll never compromise on. It's important to note that I am a very successful CEO and good looking. Criticising me is very easy if you are not any of these things. We should instead point fingers at all the women who refuse to be called John. Targeting me who is part of the solution, not the problem, is counterproductive, as I will never change.",11m,912,107,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"`Explain this gap in your CV.` You might think this is a gauche question for me to ask a potential hire, but it is something I need to know. Why? Why should I care? Because I need to know if you were using that period to go back in time to kill JFK. I've studied the footage. The only way JFK could've been killed was by a second gunman (or gunwoman) that must have used a time machine. Why is this important for selling antivirus software? Because time travelling to kill JFK shows: - 💡resourcefulness - 💡determination - 💡ability to follow things through - 💡ability to meet deadlines - 💡a strong belief that the timeline is what we make of it These are all qualities I value in an employee and specifically only met if you were on the grassy knoll killing JFK.

"My 8 year old son fell off his bike and grazed his knee. I rushed to my first aid kit but before I gave out a plaster, I asked `how are you going to pay for it?` He was screaming in pain and saying he already spent his pocket money for the week. `That wasn't very smart was it? What happens if you have an accident you're not prepared for?` I told him he might have to give back his bike to pay for the plaster and he screamed about how unfair that was. Sorry, the business world is unfair. I could see he learned his lesson so I agreed to give him the plaster this time for free but he now had a choice. He could either invest 30% of his pocket money every week to pay for future medical emergencies, or the next time he suffers an accident he'd have to give up his whole bike. He took the first option.

I got one of my business contacts who worked in prosthetics to build a realistic looking nose, and bought a few batches of fake blood.

I was sitting on the front row of a comedy gig and the comedian started making fun of me just because I was yelling things out during his routine and ruining his punchlines. I thought the crowd would be on my side because I make more money and was better dressed than he was. However, when I told the comedian that my watch costs more than his house, the crowd booed me? Is this what society has become? You are booed at simply for being a success? I can't help that I'm rich. I was simply born this way. Comedy used to mean something, back when it used to aim itself at the establishment, instead of hard-working multimillionaires who want expensive watches.

"I was at a party last night in a fancy venue and there were all sorts of free canapés. It was time to maximise. Firstly I stood in the thoroughfare by the kitchen to have the first right of refusal on anything they brought out. An old colleague and the godfather of my first child, Rodney, came up to talk to me - I'd not seen him in person in 5 years because of the pandemic. However, I did not register a word he said because I was too busy focussing on the canapés. He kept trying to usher me over to meet his new daughter, but I felt sceptical. Was he trying to lead me away from the thoroughfare? So his wife can stand guard and hoover up supplies for his recently upsized family? I stood my ground and told him I did not want to meet his boring daughter. He walked away and the thoroughfare was safe once again. Soon they brought out several samosas and goujons (my fav) and I decided to take multiple of each for my `family` (I was there alone). The waiters could not stop me and even if they tried, I would quote my rights as a consumer under contract law. Once I had pocketed about 6 goujons, 8 skewers, 12 arancini balls, 8 samosas and 4 sausage rolls, I went to collect my bag in which I had brought two boxes of tupperware. I quickly did an Irish goodbye as my mission was accomplished.

Before she arrived, I ordered every single person in the office to ignore her and treat her as invisible. There is an automatic door into the office that I decided to reprogram to no longer detect her. This turned out to be impossible but I could make it manually operated from my office, so I personally watched it until she arrived and made sure she had to tailgate other people in. When she arrived at her cubicle it was covered by police do-not-cross tape and there was a massive blood stain on the carpet, as if she had died there. I also hired a creepy child (my head of HR's nephew) to also pretend to be a ghost that was the only person to see her and say things like `where is my mommy?` Eventually we got bored around lunchtime so started talking to her again. She was suitably creeped out by the whole thing and was never late again. She eventually quit, not because of this but because the bloodstain in her office proved impossible to get out.

"I bought a burial spot for my first startup company. When my first company was declared bankrupt, I held a funeral procession for it and placed an effegy of it into a casket, which got lowered into the ground. Very few people came to this. Every year now I visit the grave to leave flowers and tell it how much it taught me about business. This year there was an elderly woman also visiting her husband's grave, whom she was married to for 50 years. Her story was touching and all, but her husband was just one man, whereas my company employed 12 people and in a way, they all died when the company went under. When I told her about my lost loved one, she burst into tears. `Losing Ernest was hard but it is nothing compared to what you and the world lost when Cartocopies folded. You are very brave.` She got it in a way no one else did. It's a shame people don't value the lives of companies as much as actual humans, just because they don't have sentience, feelings or any physical form.

"Several years ago a previous girlfriend caught me using Tinder on my phone and was very mad. She had no right to be. This is equivalent to looking at a job advert while you're currently employed. If an employer told you that you can't do that, that would be illegal. If they checked your phone like she did, that's a breach of my privacy. She said she was trying to check the weather and saw the notification which is several nude photos. I quoted that any evidence obtained unlawfully is inadmissable in court. She said `THIS is inadmissable in court` and threw my phone out the window, which I found immature. You are legally allowed to interview for other companies even if you have a perfectly good job, just like I am legally allowed to solicit buttpics even if I have a perfectly good butt at home.

We had a huge argument because I accidentally locked her out of the house by leaving the keys in the front door. She banged on the door for hours but I was playing Call of Duty with headphones in. When she eventually climbed through the slightly open kitchen window, she was livid. I understood her anger even though there was nothing anyone could have done to avoid this. Everyone makes mistakes in business and in marriage. She seemed unable to accept this. I told her `worst comes to worst, you could've slept in the car.` My solutions based  mindset seemed to make her more angry. She said sleeping in the car is horrific and I replied that it isn't, and I could do it for a whole week if I had to, so that's what I did. When I came back, she was still angry even though a) I showed her I was able to accept penance and b) I was completely right about the car thing.

"Sometimes at the end of a meeting at work, it's hard to tell when you should lean in for a kiss. I find business meetings very intimate and intense, whether it's a job interview, a performance review or an external client. This naturally leads to wanting to kiss. However, I know too well that leaning in and making them feel uncomfortable is disastrous. That's why I've invented the `I Don't Want To Be Kissed` Badge. There's a tray at the front desk that people can take them from and wear throughout the day to avoid me trying to kiss them. This should make them feel 100% safe at work. Since I introduced them, almost every single employee has started using them, especially the women. That's when you know it was a good idea.

The werewolf is trying to act as a villager, so I immediately come out and say I am a werewolf when I'm a villager, because a werewolf would never do that. It is a brilliant strategy that follows foolproof logic, even though everyone always executes me for doing this because they are logicless idiots. I've been applying this practice to the business world. For example, I once interviewed a candidate and they said `I am terrible at my job.` I hired him on the spot. Why? Someone terrible at their job would be lying about being good at their job, so I surmised they must be good at their job. Perfect logic.

For years, my previous company was in massive debt but it was important for the workers to stay positive, so I told them nothing. The same is true on a plane: plane morale is more important than anything, even one man's health. Plus, there was a small chance once I got to look at him, my instincts would kick in and I'd be able to help him. When I had a look, nothing was coming to me, but everyone was watching me.

That's when I had a genius idea and called both back in. I decided to smell them. I can deduce a lot from smelling someone - it's like a sixth sense to me. For example, when I sniffed the first candidate, I got a sense he lived in an affluent neighborhood. His coffee breath smelled like the upmarket stuff rather than a chain, and there was a strong artisan bakery scent. There was a whiff of grease oil so I knew he didn't mind getting his hands dirty. He smelled good at his job. I then brought in the second candidate. When I leaned in to smell him, he freaked out. He screamed `what are you doing` and had to leave. I knew immediately he wasn't right for this position. What a shame, but sometimes you just know it's not going to work. We hired the first candidate.

However, I briefly felt exactly what it would be like to get fired. The pain. The confusion. The uncertainty. I couldn't do that to Jonathan, especially as he was creative enough to try the Uno play. So I rehired him. I later explained what happened to MY bosses and guess what? They fired me. So Jonathan's reverse card did work in the end. Guess we were playing Uno after all.",1y,1079,89,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"My 12 year old daughter got diagnosed with ADHD and I couldn't be prouder of her, but not for the reason you think. She said to me `Dad, I don't think I have ADHD but I think I can get a diagnosis in 2 years by studying for the test.` Me: `No, impossible, they're trained professionals.` Her: `Oh so you don't think I can achieve anything I want by working hard enough?` Me: `I guess not.` Her: `I guess there's no point me studying for my GCSEs then.` She had me there. So I let her try this. She researched different places to take the rest and maximised her chances by studying famous people with ADHD like Justin Timberlake and Bart Simpson. Fast forward two years and she's achieved the impossible, and she sells the ADHD meds she's prescribed on the internet to make a tidy profit too.

I sell a very important product (bank security software) that protects people's livelihoods I also hire and employ hundreds, who would not be able to put food on the table if I didn't. Ambulances also indiscriminate. They have to save whoever calls them up, even if they're a murderer or bad at their job. I get to choose who I hire. The ambulance can only save one life.

Now replace `dishes` with `come into the office and work on next week's case`. No longer crazy apparently, according to employment law. Why? We should treat the two situations the exact same. Sometimes your company is more like a family than an office. Sometimes being in a loving supportive family requires hard sacrifices. And sometimes hard sacrifices means someone stepping up and working Sunday evening without being a little bitch about overtime.

"We need to talk about ageism in the workplace. Ageism is just like racism or sexism, but for old people. However I've found it works both ways, with young ages too. For example, I have just hired a 13 year old as the head of social media at my company. Many people were outraged, saying he is underqualified for this role and I only hired him because he is my son (which he is.) THAT is ageism. They wouldn't be saying that if he was 22, and I know this because no one complained when I hired my 22 year old son. Many are calling this hire `inappropriate`, `unlawful` and `child labour`. I just shake my head in dismay at it all.

That company went into liquidation and I didn't get a penny, even though they still paid themselves and others. That's when I realised: liquidation frees you from any obligations, it is a blessing not a curse. For example, my friend, Carl, lent me £2000 to cover my dental costs, or did they? What they didn't realise was they were lending it to my limited liability company, Edgesoft, which was having financial difficulty and is now in liquidation. Bye bye £2,000. Another friend, Samantha, drove me to the airport a few months ago and wanted me to drive them this month in return. No, they really drove TrueData employee to the airport, which is now in liquidation. No ride for you, Sam. I was dogsitting for my neighbour while they were away in Malta, or was I?

Why then, do we not celebrate corporate mergers the same way? Why did Exxon and Mobile gather in a church and declare their vows to be true to each other? Why didn't Penguin and Random House stand in front of a priest and enshrine their partnership under God? Why didn't AT&T and Time Warner go on holiday together after? Perhaps because this extra pageantry is good short term, but doesn't provide long term partnership success. Hence why these big companies have stayed together and I've had many divorces. That's why I will conduct my next wedding like a corporate merger. We will both bring our closest advisors and hash out the terms of our marriage over a long business table in a formal productive and legally robust way.

I ran one for the #2 Password Manager service in the world. In the games, people truly reveal themselves, and I let them. I encourage things to get truly personal to reach maximum conflict. For example, I made the two co-founders the werewolves, but instead of showing a card that said `you are a werewolf`, I also showed Paul a card that said `Jeff (the other  werewolf) is sleeping with your wife.` to see what happened. It turned out Jeff had been sleeping with his wife. The two had a massive row with each other and actually started a physical fight, and everyone knew they were the werewolves. It's crazy how silly little games can make us behave sometimes. Sufficed to say, that company fell apart and is no longer the #2 Password Manager in the world now. Who is? My company.

Not only did I do more keepie-uppies, I was still going for 15 minutes after him, and he begged me to stop because he was bored and wanted to get an ice lolly. `Okay,` I said, `now you have to get some of my new coin.` He said `sorry I have to go to practice` and just left. I never heard from him again. Had he invested in my coin, he would've made 20x his money back and had more confidence in the match last night. The fault of any football match loss rests squarely on the football employees. If a manager ever made a mistake, it is that they were too trusting of others to follow their vision. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and that link is never the CEO.",1y,34,1,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc

I subtly hinted that if he agreed not to say bad things about our company, then I will `put in extra effort to find it`, which is again a true statement as I knew exactly where it was.

"I was playing Fortnite online and I was being flamed for being an `Old Man with No Skills` by a teenager. I told them I was a CEO and I didn't care because I made loads of money. They said none of that matters if I suck at Fortnite. This shook me. I'd never told anyone about my success and not have it seem impressive. This kid just didn't care about my company's return on investment. Then it hit me, for them, being good at Fortnite is their measure of success. It was a real eye opening experience to me about what things matter to different people. So I tracked down their IP and paid Epic Games £10,000 to shadowban them permanently from the game.

"You are never truly alone or without friends in the modern world. Here's why. One night I was feeling lonely as all my friends were busy and I wanted to hang out. So I decided to wander the streets alone. While I was out, I noticed a sign that was advertising Sky TV's True Detective. It reminded me how a friend also suggested this show. That's when it hit me. Billboards are your friends too. Think about it. What are friends for, but to suggest things for you to enrich your own life with? In fact, adverts can do that job even better because they have a graphic design budget behind them. You don't need friends anymore as long as advertising exists. Your true friends?

"You have to be prepared to make cuts. Sometimes you cannot afford to pay all your workers. Sometimes a worker is being incompetent and lousy. Last Summer, I had a team of 5 employees. Four were doing amazingly, producing great work constantly and always making the effort. The last was slacking, late for all their appointments and being generally bad vibes. News came that our budget was slashed 20%. It came to a tough decision, but I had to let the underperfoming employee leave. I told them to pack their things and go - they no longer had my support. This story is actually about my five children. The youngest, then 16, was forced to move out as they were failing their GCSEs.

"I'm a very big proponent of boycotts. They are incredibly important and I will lay down my life for a cause. However I also really enjoy Eurovision. That's when I came up with an ingenious idea: boycott offsetting. If I can convince two friends to boycott it, I can still watch it guilt free and still be net +1 boycott. No one would bite. I then offered to pay two strangers £200 each, but most people thought it was a scam. That's when I knew I was ahead of my time. Suddenly, a brain wave. I had access to a whole load of employees I had direct power over and could manipulate without consequence. I found out casually who would be watching the show during the week. I then invented a fake deadline that meant two of them had to work Saturday between 8pm - 12am (I convinced them it was our Sydney clients because of the timezone). I then blocked BBC iPlayer in the office so they could not catch a glimpse of it. Voila, boycott offsetting completed.

"It's very important to get honest feedback from your employees. I have a very thick skin so can take criticism.

I collect the box at the end of the week and read them through. I did this for 2 years with no problem. It started as jovial roasts about my haircut, or the way I sit on my chair. However, since I enacted a pay freeze at work, they seem to be focussed on that. People are so shallow and money obsessed. I couldn't take it, so I put a chip into every single employee's form so I could identify them. I have also memorised their handwriting - this took months of revision.

I misheard you the first seven times.` I went into the interview and luckily I had enough experience in interviews to be able to walk it. They offered me a job on the spot. Now came a problem.

"I was watching Physical 100 with my partner, where 100 top athletes compete in tough physical challenges. The contestants accomplished impressive feats but there were too many tasks focussed on raw body strength, and no tasks that tested the physical endurance needed to be an impressive CEO of a large company. My partner kept commenting how they were very attractive but how did she know, when she hasn't seen them in a business environment? After all, being able to do weighted squats lifting 250kg would get you nowhere in a board meeting with investors or while negotiating a merger. Had I been on Physical 100, I would have an advantage that very few of them had: lots of money. I can pay an athlete to push a minecart with 1.5 tons of weights, but very few athletes could 100m hurdle their way into a Fortune 500 company.

"Is wire tapping your employees legal, and should you do it? The answer to the first question is obviously no, it is not, but the second has a much complex answer than you think. I did a trial of it in my old CEO position back in 2007, way before wokeness had made monitoring your employees' phone conversations problematic. There was one employee that I will name C. I was a bit suspicious that C was a spy from a rival company, so I listened in to their phone conversations, and the worst happened: I heard them being mean about me. This sent me into such a rage that I swore off ever doing it again. It was such a big mistake. What you don't know can't hurt you. The next week I decided to be extra nice to C, taking time to be a better boss and an attentive listener to their needs. C seemed warmer to me. It was a true moment of personal growth. On Friday, I decided to listen in to C's phone conversations again. This time, I heard them on the phone to their doctor. C was describing their symptoms and the Doctor prescribed medication and said it was no big deal, but I could tell by the nature of C's cough and the tempo of their breathing, it was a much more serious chest infection than the Doctor thought. I was now faced with a moral dilemma: warn C about their health or keep it to myself. Of course, I'm no monster, so I warned them, and they went into hospital and got the treatment they needed. They said if they hadn't caught this virus early then potentially C would have had only 5 years to live. So obviously, everything I did was illegal. But immoral? Well, why don't you ask C's children, who would be without a parent right now?

"Just reading about the rise of the `sheconomy` which is a clever cross between the words `she` and `autonomy`. But what is fuelling this rise? Brands expect that by 2028, women will account for 75% of discretionary spending. That means that at this rate, by 2038, women will account for over 144% of discretionary spending! This is worrying as men will be -44%, and women must grow 1.4 in size to account for this demand. But what explains this change? Let's look at my own workplace practices. I'm a big practiser of `shequality` which a clever cross between the words `she` and `quality`. A few years ago I read about this concept called `impostor syndrome` which told me that all women must feel like impostors all the time. That's why I make sure women are given very important leadership roles and high pay even if they aren't qualified, so they can truly be an impostor. Under my leadership, I make sure women are always at the top of the ladder (although they must stay one rung below me because I'm CEO). Men on the other hand must be treated like the worms they are. A few years ago I read about this concept called `mansplaining` which is a clever cross between the words `man` and `plain`, which is that men are really plain and boring whenever they open their mouth. That's why I refuse to listen to any man, in any situation. So how did women get so empowered and rich? Simple. The actions of great men like myself. Be like me.

"I saw a snake being attacked by a pack of wild foxes, so I rescued it. When I picked up the snake to nurse it, it bit me causing excruciating pain and causing me to drop my backpack. It wouldn't let me near it and kept attacking me if I tried. A regular man would have killed the snake right then and there out of revenge. But no, I held out my palm and calmly said `Let me have my sweater, and I will let you have 3% of the these that I find.` I showed it a small sack of fish eggs. The snake relented and let me have my backpack back. I essentially sold it a stock option. Someone who was watching approached me and said: “That snake bit you. Why are you still trying to help it?” I replied: “The nature of the snake is to bite, but that's not going to change my nature, which is to make very good business deals.” Do not change your nature simply because someone harms you.

"Let me tell you what I think is the most oppressed group in business: people who work in internal comms. Sure it doesn't have the pizazz of PR or the incredibly high sex appeal of marketing, but people who work in IC are human beings too. Meet Helen, she worked in IC at my old company. She saw there was a space open at a lunch table with a bunch of the PR team. `Sorry Helen, this seats taken,` one of the men said. She was confused, she didn't see any stuff. `By whom?` `By someone not working in IC. Someone with a real job.` She was so taken aback she dropped her jacket potato. `Ooh ooh what you gonna do? Write an internal newsletter about it?` the man continued. `IC prick!` Then he got the others at the table to chant `IC! IC! IC! IC someone without any career advancement options!` which was hard to coordinate but still hurtful. Helen ran away crying. It should not have happened. Especially because the man who started chanting was me. I'm sorry Helen. I was a different person back then, blind to my own biases. The truth is the bullying people in IC receive is worse than any discrimination, or hate speech. And I didn't realise that, not until September 2014 when I received an internal newsletter that said someone at the company was willing to donate a kidney to someone who needed it. My son needed a kidney then. Internal comms singlehandedly saved his life. It saved mine. I owe Helen everything. Go out and hug an IC.

"My 7 year-old daughter did the dishes last night, and picked up the cat poo in the garden. After she finished she asked me for `overtime pay`. At first I was taken aback, but eventually I was happy to give it to her because it showed assertiveness. I offered her £5 per dish she washed and £10 per poo of cat she picked up, a lowly wage to not spoil my child. However, she began feeding our cat laxatives so he'd poo more, and our garden was constantly filled with it. She was now working non stop to clean dishes and pick up cat poo. She was so tired, breaking down into tears that I considered cutting her off, but it was an important lesson in the dangers of overtime pay. Eventually she started screaming that I need to take away her `overtime pay`, which I did and now she is back to happily cleaning the dishes for free. I won. This is why being paid more can actually be negative, and why my employees only get half pay for working overtime and I refuse any pay rise.

"The commute is essential to a healthy body and mind. It's the stretch before a marathon. The vocal warm up before a Beyonce performance. Think of Dave, coming into work at 9am having spent 90 mins on a packed train, underground and 2 buses. Being in that environment with other like minded visionaries. He's rested from the quiet contemplation. His head brimming with once in a lifetime ideas for how to fire more employees and outsourcing the jobs overseas. Without those 90 minutes, he would not have those great ideas. I really wish I could pay him extra for that time. Meanwhile, I live right next door to my office. Might as well be a Neanderthal. That's why I've created the solution: an artificial commute. Every morning I take my private helicopter out for 30 minutes around the building, so I can also have my own `commute`. It's invigorating.

I don't own a single book in my house, except Adam Smith's `The Invisible Hand` which I've read a thousand times as a child. A-ha! The local library! They will surely have some books.

It can also lead to decreased productivity, burnout, and even resentment towards the employer.` If an employee said this to me, I would fire them on the spot. However, ChatGPT doesn't fear being fired, so you cannot threaten them. That makes it a very dangerous employee. AI is very scary that way.

"I was invited to speak at my old primary school for International Women's Day. I figured there must have been an admin error so I politely decline, but they said `No! We must have you!` Not questioning it, I turned up. When I arrived, I asked the principal (a woman) why I was speaking when I'm a man, and she said it's important that men's voices and opinions are heard too on this day. I told her I disagreed and spent 10 minutes explaining why. Before I went on stage I noticed an elderly woman sitting at the back of the audience. `Who is she?` I asked. `Her name's Janet. She's the school nurse, been working here 40 years,` I was told. `Oh I remember her! Why isn't she speaking?` `Because she's a nurse, and you're a successful CEO.` This unsettled me deeply, because for all we knew she could also have been a CEO as well, and therefore just as important. I took to the stage to make my speech. I stood in silence for a minute, and then said `it's important that I leave space for the women to speak. I would like to invite to the stage, Janet, the school nurse.` Shocked, she took to the stage. She said some inspirational words about her time at the school, and then starting to talk about how things were much worse now. The audience politely nodded, until she said she thought there were too many non-white skinned people ruining everything. She then made some crass remarks about gender and was ushered off stage quickly. That goes to show the important lesson of today's events.

"Hello, LinkedIn family! I was driving my Mustang today and it got me thinking about something important - the power of dreams and aspirations. You see, owning a Mustang has been a lifelong dream of mine. As a child, I used to stare in awe at these powerful machines, dreaming of the day I would own one myself. And now, I'm happy to say that I'm living that dream, because I now own a Mustang. But the truth is, owning a Mustang is more than just a material possession. It's a symbol of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. It's a testament to the fact that with enough determination, anything is possible, especially owning your own Mustang, which I do. And I believe that this is something that everyone can apply to their own lives. Whether it's a new car (like my Mustang), a new house with a big huge garage (to house your Mustang), or a personal goal (Mustang) it's important to never give up on your aspirations. So to anyone out there who may be struggling or feeling like their dreams are out of reach, I want to encourage you to keep driving forward, or occasionally backwards when I need to park in my big huge garage, but this is only so when I'm leaving the house again I'm driving forwards immediately.

Nonetheless, we are overlooked and must cease and we must start appreciating marketers for what they are: after all, how did the Clap for Carers start?

"We used to have a VIP Bathroom in our office, but it hit me. VIP stands for `Very Important Person`, but every single person who works in my company is very important, to me. That's why we made all bathrooms VIP bathrooms that can be used by all employees. However, the old VIP bathroom is much larger and nicer and has a better scent than the other bathrooms and too many people were using it over the other bathrooms. So, we decided to make it an EIP-only bathroom, where three of our VIPs will also be EIPs. (EIP stands for Extremely Important Person.) This is a much fairer system because now everyone is important in our company. hashtag # VIP hashtag # Motivation hashtag # business hashtag # humanresources hashtag # contentment",3y,20,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"A very clever thing in our applicant test for joining our company is at the end of the questions we ask them to predict their result. One man, Candidate A we'll call him (not his real name) scored 70℅ but predicted he got 98% at the end, which was a vast overestimation. A woman, Candidate B (no relation) only got 66%, but she predicted she got about 58%, a slight underestimation. A worse result but a more accurate self-assessment. Who did I hire? Neither. A third candidate, Candidate C achieved a score of 10%, a score he then predicted dead on. I think the most important facet above all else is knowing your own ability, more important than competency, showing up on time and not doing drugs in the office toilets. Candidate C clearly knew himself, so I hired him even if he was definitely on cocaine.

One gave birth to me (my mother) and another, I gave birth to (my daughter - not literally, but I did steal her from the hospital maternity ward myself). Another, my wife, we give birth to each other, mentally. All three do my laundry. That's why today I have given all female employees a special bonus: triple overtime pay if they work over 15 hours.

"Ever since Wordle kicked off at my company, it's been popular among my employees. Most found a good bit of fun, but I was unique to see it as a social phenomenon that has profound implications in the workplace. Long story short, I started cheating at Wordle. At first I went balls to the wall and threw out a few 2s and my employees were majorly impressed, which helped reinforce my authority as the CEO and therefore the smartest person at the company. However, I got addicted to the high and started throwing out some 1's - that's when Chris got suspicious of me and started asking to check my results. I panicked as I had been simply manually typing in the green squares to our Slack chat without playing the game at all (a clever exploit that's a result of Wordle's code itself). That's when I started playing the game, but first on a burner phone that I already use for drug deals and affairs to find out the word. I also got smarter with hiding my tracks, throwing in a few 3s, 4s, 5s and 6s, so much that my results look almost identical to anyone playing the game normally. Why have I gone through so much effort? In a company like mine, winning is everything, especially if you are King. It doesn't matter how you get there.

It was 2pm on a Saturday. That's when it hit me. Of course! Our greatest innovation of the last decade is how we are all connected and no longer limited by regular office hours.

"Next time your boss tells you `you're fired` don't say `you can't fire me, I quit`. Many employees have done this when I have fired them and it hurts my feelings every time. It is simply mean.

She was visibly upset and that's when I learned  it is harder to be the breaker-upper than the breakee-uppee. The same is true for firing whether it's an unfair dismissal or not.

"My 7 year-old daughter came home from school and told me that a man told her to `smile` today. Normally I would have called the police and had him arrested but she had it covered. She stood up to him and said `actually telling women to smile is sexist and upholds a patriarchal society that wants to control us, so you should stop.` The man burst into tears. `I'm not a sexist!` He exclaimed. `I'm just doing my job as the school photographer.` Flimsy excuses. She then mobilised the other girls in her class to support her, along with some of the boys too. They signed an e-petition that got 3,000 signatures and that was just from members of their class. The photographer was fired and girls were now banned from smiling in photos, and boys were forced to smile under punishment of exclusion, to know what it was like to live in a society which pressures you into smiling. Later, as she was walking home, she spotted the photographer packing his tripod into the back of his car. She was worried he would be angry so tried to avoid him, but he stopped her. `Thank you, wise child` he said, tearfully. `Because of you I am quitting my misogynist job and going back to university. I'm going to retrain as a feminist ally.` `No, thank you.` She said, magnanimously, and smiled. As was her choice.

"Recreation is as important as work. Occasionally we have an away day at the company where we play board games. Last week we were playing a niche but glorious board game known as `Risk`. I picked it because my dozen years in financial risk management meant I would crush the game. Six hours into the game, my employee Rufus was close to defeating me. Normally I would say losing is a bad thing, but it can also be a learning experience. As we were rolling the final round of dice I `accidentally` flipped the board over. This completely ruined the game as we were unable to recall with 100% certainty the positions of the pieces. `I guess I win then,` Rufus remarked. `Not so fast,` I cut in. I pulled out the rulebook and pointed to a clause that said in the event of an accidental board flip, the game would be forced into a rematch. `That makes no sense! Let me see!` Rufus whinged, like a baby. Talk about toxic masculinity and entitlement. True enough, the rule was there in the rulebook. Of course, I had long ago printed my own edited version of the rulebook for this very situation. `Fine! We'll have a rematch,` he stropped. `Deal.` The next day I fired him from the company and blocked him on all social media.

"We hired a magician to play at our annual summer party. Most of my employees were skeptical, thinking magic is merely a thing the uneducated or poor people enjoy. `It's not real, it's all trickery and manipulation, not like advertising or the stock market,` many said. I was not so ready to rule him out. The magician arrived, and started doing some tricks. He pulled a rabbit out of a hat and Jason, an experienced team leader who had been working for us for 5 years, stood up and said, `I'm not that impressed until you can pull a hat out of the rabbit.` Everyone laughed and the magician looked sad. The magician replied, `I don't come to your workplace and make fun of you doing your job.` Jason shot back `that's because I'm brilliant at my job. I make £100k a year through my understanding of market forces. Bet you don't even know how to do a cost-benefit analysis.` `No...I can't.` The magician looked downbeat. As everyone continued to laugh, the magician soon became violent. He pulled out his magician's baton and began threatening Jason. He swung at Jason, who dodged it and then was able to disarm the magician without any problem. Everyone applauded. Jason then turned to everyone and said, `you see everyone, magic is stupid, right? A magician could never do what we do.` Everyone agreed and cheered. `...or can they?` Everyone looked a bit confused. Jason then picked up the rabbit from the earlier trick, and continued to pull a hat out of the rabbit. He then took off his business attire to reveal a magician's outfit similar to the hired magician, who suddenly rises up from the floor. `That was merely my assistant,` Jason continued. `I have been the magician all along, and my greatest trick was infiltrating this company five years ago, rising up through the ranks. You see, a magician can do what you do, even better than any of you!` Everyone was in shock.

"As a rule, I don't share polls. They disgust me and even seeing one makes me want to puke. But this raises an interesting point. I'm a lawyer and I went to one of the worst state comprehensive schools in the world, if you believe in league tables (which I do). The school had no carpets, or textbooks and it was at the bottom of an abandoned coal mine, just below a nuclear test site. The teachers were not trained and were hired actors who were asked to read from scripts. Also, the mine was haunted, by the ghosts of the scientists who worked on the failed nuclear experiments. Also, there were rats. But has it held me back? Not even a bit. I am now a world-class lawyer, maybe the inspiration for the Phoenix Wright character. I have represented some of the world's worst criminals and government cabinet ministers, all of whom now roam free today. When I go to court I'm hounded by my army of fangirls who want my autograph and my advice on how to avoid lifetime imprisonment for murder. I'm the BTS of the law world. The truth is it doesn't matter where you go to school as long as you have talent, drive and parents who are very rich powerful businesspeople like my own, who also have a hand in organised crime. So state, private, or even no education at all, it doesn't matter and it's about what YOU do. It was ME that worked hard, it was ME that applied to law school, it was ME that asked my parents to coerce the administrators using their unlimited wealth and sending threatening men to their houses at night, so they would let me in.

"I attended a virtual conference with other managers and the main focus was on whether it's important to treat your employees like human beings. The person speaking before me made the point that you are paying then so that shows you care way more than things like remembering their name or saying hello to them when they come into your office. A compelling point but when I took the floor, I told everyone that I make sure to have a full conversation with everyone I hire. Everyone's jaws dropped as if I had claimed unions were a good thing or managers don't need to have a business degree. I told them a story about how I sat down with my new employee Jacob and asked him to tell me about his family. He opened up quickly and told me how he took care of his three children and mother. I told him it was very similar to how I take care of my children aka my company. We bonded. Later, we were negotiating his new contract. Luckily using the knowledge from our DMC, I could leverage my position into a better contract for me, knowing he couldn't risk unemployment. The other managers were astonished - this blew their mind.

"An employer/employee relationship is much like a marriage. However, it is also unlike a marriage in the sense that a boss should not expect their workers to cook for them, especially if it's the exact beef lasagne my wife does. I learned this the hard way, when I asked Brian to do this, and when he refused, I was upset and asked if this meant he no longer liked me. He found this exchange very awkward and handed in his notice, which at the time, felt very much like a divorce. I grew from this though, and learned to never get close to my employees, which meant no more backrubs from my personal assistant, and also I ended several affairs. I also found out that it applies the other way - you shouldn't expect your wife to answer your phone calls or manage your diary, no matter how high a salary you offer her. This put a real strain on our marriage leading to our separation, which very much felt like a divorce at the time (because it was one). hashtag # family hashtag # life hashtag # smallbusiness",4y,5,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc

"Here's a learning experience. My eldest son who is now 21 came up to me in 2007 (he was only 7 at the time). He said `Daddy, Daddy, I have a business idea!` He explained it to me and it sounded like utter nonsense at the time, so I sent him to his room without supper for wasting my time during work hours. The business idea he described was, almost word-for-word, the description of blockchain technology, aka bitcoin. Of course he didn't call it bitcoin, he called it `shadow sauce`, but it was otherwise the exact idea behind cryptocurrency. `Shadow sauce would be a decentralised digital currency!` My 7-year old insisted. I scoffed, and mocked him until he cried. That would never happen today, because he is now 21 and he's learned to suppress his emotions to get ahead in business. The irony is, spoiler alert, that cryptocurrency took off in a big way and I would be a trillionaire by now if only I had listened to the boy. To think, all this time I thought my son was dumb, but really, *I* was the dumb one. Let this be a lesson to you all: the mind of a child is truly wonderful and creative, and you should pour all your money into their business ideas no matter what. cliffnotes: my 7-year old son invented cryptocurrency first and I told him it was a stupid idea, now I'm laughing hashtag # entrepreneur hashtag # learning hashtag # creative hashtag # business hashtag # technology hashtag # cryptocurrency hashtag # money hashtag # goodfather",4y,11,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc

"Life is a constant journey of self-reflection and improvement. In my local neighbourhood, many saw me as a villain. I caused a popular independent restaurant to close down simply by launching a hostile takeover with my large amount of funds. After that, I became persona-non-grata in the local coffee shop. When I went in, people would spit in my coffee, but I saw this as an opportunity to grow: I continued to go into that coffee shop every day, ordered my usual Frappuccino and trained myself to get used to the idea of drinking a beverage laden with saliva. After all, it is simply an arbitrary fear. We kiss people all the time and this is no different. So, every time I sipped from that cup of coffee, which I knew full well had been tainted, the more powerful I became. Now, I could easily drink a coffee cup full of spit and not bat an eye-lid, and I feel the same way about the abuse I get from the other customers. Completely hardened to it. Not all personal growth is conventional. Sometimes, it's about accepting who you are and rolling with it. For some, it's about accepting you'll never be an astronaut, or champion kickboxer. Me? I'm the guy who is 100% okay with drinking spit. hashtag # opportunity hashtag # growth hashtag # people hashtag # coffee hashtag # restaurant hashtag # entrepreneurship hashtag # strength",4y,2,1,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"Firing an employee is never easy, but sometimes it's not about easy. I was planning to fire my assistant last month because he didn't bring me my coffee and instead left the office because his wife went into labour. I hesitated though, thinking was this the best time to do so, knowing there's a child on the way? However, I thought about it and it occurred to me: there is no perfect time to get sacked. After all, when the stock price drops, will the shareholders accept the news of a baby as an excuse? No, and that's why I don't accept that as an excuse for mistakes like forgetting my coffee. When he returned to the office, elated to be a father, I fired him on the spot. There is never a perfect time to fire someone, so why not do it while they're very happy so it cancels out.

"People often say `follow your dreams` but I say no, follow your nightmares instead. It is important to do something that scares you every day. For example, I had a nightmare a few years ago that I was having an affair with my best friend's wife. I woke up in a cold sweat, utterly terrified of the monster I had become. Adultery has always scared me, because of the lives it can ruin. However, the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like a good idea. I always thought I had no interest in sleeping with Paul's wife, but was that because I didn't want to, or because I was too scared? `Follow your nightmares,` I told myself, and I began a prolonged relationship with Nina. Doing something that scares you makes you stronger, and this was no different. This was a huge boost to my self-confidence that translated in the workplace too, where I started having affairs with a lot of my employees. Soon, Paul discovered what we were doing in the most unexpected way possible: I told him as a power move. He was upset. He lashed out, called me names, but I did not resent him. I simply felt sorry for him as he was too scared, too scared to cuckold another man. I left him with nothing but a lesson: `Follow Your Nightmares`.

"Losing a loved one is tough, but not as tough as losing your money on a poorly-timed investment.

"It takes a lot to be a successful entrepreneur. Let me share the story of my 9 year old child. He arrived at his school with nothing but £200 in his pocket. He realised that the other kids were physically stronger than him but he had something they wanted: £200 in cash. One day he was surrounded by many bigger boys, but my son stood his ground. He told them that if they steal his money today that'll be it, no more money - a very bad business investment! Also potentially he can use his connections in the police department to have them all arrested for life. He offered them a counter-proposal: he employ them as security for £2 a day each. This way, they will have guaranteed earnings for their whole time at school, instead of earning a measly £200 that day. Plus they will have the mental health benefits of gainful employment, and will be deterred from crime and hard drugs. Soon, the other children heard tale of this protection scheme and wanted some security to protect their own hundreds of pounds too, so my son was able to get more work for the previously unemployed hooligans. The trick was, the children were willing to pay at least £5 a day, so my son was banking £3 a day for each hire. Occasionally, someone would refuse protection, but my son would simply hire someone to threaten them the next lunch break and they'd come crawling back. This was often done at a loss in the short term but would eventually pay off because it allowed him to increase his market share and create a monopoly. Overall, my son did a lot of good here. he was able to take on the epidemic of school bullying and monetize it, turning it into a legal and regulated industry and creating a new healthy equilibrium. Every child pays a daily subscription to use his personal security force, and not one has had their money stolen since.

He got out his phone and showed that he had hired several employees to handstitch his outfit for him on low wages. He then showed them he had registered as a public limited company and the IPO was already at £300,000 market cap. My son: I may not be a billionaire but can any of the other kids say they are a CEO?

"Hello everyone. I was just visiting a farm in the Hertfordshire countryside and it made me think: what is it about the simplicity of a goat that can help me make my business 15% more efficient? Start with the horns. The horns are me hiring a very strong law department to defeat anyone who will sue my company for sidestepping trading regulations, environmental safety or the Geneva Convention. Only a goat could do help me think of that. Take the way a goat runs. That is exploiting tax loopholes, of course. A greatly pleasing measure that only evolutionary biology could've come up with. Now when I go to feed the goat, it bites my hand, but if I tie it's mouth up with some very strong rope, not only can it not bite me but it has to eat anything I feed it. This is removing any employment rights and extra benefits from all my employees. Wonderful idea that could only be inspired by the accidental ingenuity of nature. This is free advice for any of those looking to get ahead in entrepreneurism. I recommend visiting taking time away from the city from time to time, and visiting my goat farm in South Herts.

"My 5-year old son was acting up in the car on the way to Southampton so I did the only thing I could: I decided to cancel my child. There is no better punishment for your children in the 21st Century than putting a black mark against their reputation for years to come. I got a Twitter hashtag going hashtag # cancelbrian , and I went to his school and told his classmates what he'd done. They now saw him for the scourge that he was and he was cast out from most social circles. Brian felt very bad about this, as he should, and he apologised. Unfortunately, the apology wasn't remotely sufficient: he blamed his `younger sister`, `the ambient temperature of the car` and `the fact we didn't have time to buy him lunch` instead of focusing on his own shortcomings. It was clear he hadn't learned. As a result, he'll be stepping back from public life and his front-seat privileges will be revoked. He now never steps out of line, very quiet and living in a constant paranoia that his tarnished reputation will be dragged under the limelight. One day, I hope he will find it within himself to reach the maturity expected of him in public society, and we can finally bring ourselves to forgive Brian. Until then, I will enjoy the peace and quiet. Cancelling my son was the best thing we've ever done.",6y,14,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc

"Please write me a recommendation. I am currently feeling unappreciated for my stellar work in the business world. My e-mail response rate is incredibly high and I limit my procrastination in office hours to Sporcle quizzes about geography, so very relevant learning in today's global economy. I reloaded the stapler last week and no one said a thing. At the last meeting I brought a tin of celebrations. Granted it was leftover from Xmas and winter festivities so there were only Mars left. But they went down a treat, a great move by me especially in today's sharing economy. That's one thing you can say about me: I'm very good at sharing, in some cases even oversharing, in all senses of the word. I let people come into my house and take anything they want, from the fridge or any priceless African art I have on display. As they do this I tell them about how often I have dark thoughts (almost twice nightly!). I also make sure that I make sure I look fuckable while I am at my desk, while not too fuckable that it becomes unprofessional. The perfect balance in today's sex-fueled economy.
