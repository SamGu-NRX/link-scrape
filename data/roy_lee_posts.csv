"A 10-second clip of a girl on a virtual date got us over 6M views for Cluely. Here’s why it went viral (and how to make a viral UGC video): 1) It follows a viral hook format Every week, we have hundreds of UGC creators testing different viral formats and seeing what will go viral. As SOON as we spot a hook that works, we double-down and have our entire team of creators start making similar videos. This viral hook came after we noticed that brainrot videos of dating scenarios was working. 2) The video is actually funny Content has to either be extremely entertaining, relatable, or educational to go viral. This is not educational in the slightest but is very relatable and funny. Everyone has been on a horrible first date, and in no world is a video of a performative male trying to flex his minimum-wage McDonalds job not going to be entertaining. 3) It’s maximized for engagement This video has a MILLION different talking points for people to engage with. Beyond the actual interaction, we have on-screen Snapchat text, sped-up audio, and a caption designed to get viewers to comment. These small talking points ADD UP, and each contributes to its virality. This format is endlessly repeatable for UGC: Take the most absurd situation you think will go viral → tie in your product somewhere along the way. You can always make your content more converting. But it is very hard to make content more viral. Get something to a million views and worry about conversions later. video link: https://lnkd.in/gHUwDTtQ try Cluely free now: https://cluely.com/",3w,360,17,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo
"I genuinely just killed Leetcode. You've probably heard already, but Meta just announced they’re going to let candidates use AI in technical interviews. This is likely a direct result from this past year when I built Interview Coder ( the very first version of Cluely ), an invisible AI tool that let you pass Leetcode interviews using AI. I used it to get a bunch of tech offers, got ~200 million views online, got kicked out of school, and grew it to millions of dollars in revenue. Every day as this was happening, I would get anonymous DM's (and job offers) from some of the craziest names in tech. > Staff engineers at the biggest companies telling me that engineering leadership was seriously discussing me and the future of hiring. > Researchers at some of the biggest labs in the world telling me they were quiet supporters. > Senior engineers at so many random companies + startups asking if I wanted a job. There was honestly at least one staff level engineer from every single FAANG company who privately DM'ed me telling me I was changing the industry. It's an insanely vindicating feeling knowing that the dominoes are officially starting to fall for the death of Leetcode and quite surreal to think that, despite half the internet calling me low integrity and claiming I'd never change anything, I was responsible for an industry-wide shift. You can really do anything you want if you take risks and swing big. > Article: https://lnkd.in/gSsKFcrV > Interview Coder still live and STILL undetectable btw (will work until remote Leetcode interviews are truly truly dead): www.interviewcoder.com",3w,2525,116,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo

"Launching Cluely gave me the WORST impostor syndrome of my life. 3 months ago, I woke up every day wondering when Cluely would burn down and collapse. I felt a shit ton of pressure that I couldn’t achieve what I set out to do. If I could tell myself one thing during that time, it would be this: The ONLY thing that matters is that you keep going. When you take massive risks and bet on yourself (which is necessary to build anything meaningful), this feeling is inevitable. It feels like the whole world is collapsing on you every day, but it’s just your brain adjusting to a massive amount of change in your environment. If you decide to push through this feeling, things WILL start to click. Unfortunately, most people give up during this time and let this fear of failure block them from ever finding the momentum to make it work. This is self-sabotage and the biggest mistake you can make. Even now, while the fear is still there (it probably always will be), things become a little more stable every day. Impostor syndrome is all mental.

"If you’re uniquely good at ANYTHING, you can make millions $$$ right now. Here’s why: The internet has completely flipped what's valuable. The 16-year-old who shitposts and edits brainrot TikToks is now more valuable to a startup than a McKinsey consultant with 2 MBAs who’s never posted in their life. I’ve experienced it firsthand. This is what I believe I’m GENUINELY world-class at: 1. Engagement baiting on X 2. Handling online hate Two years ago, neither of these would’ve been considered valuable OR relevant for building a startup. These skills are now the meta for solving distribution at a startup.

You just have to reframe the thinking that your weird talents aren’t worth anything.

"People put limitations on themselves WAY too early. In the past 6 months, I've learned more than at any other point in my life and destroyed the myth that certain skills are “unlearnable”. Prior to Cluely , I had never launched a successful startup. I had ZERO idea how to: > build enterprise-grade software > hire world-class talent > raise millions of dollars > go viral on social media I had 1,000 followers and failed at 3 previous startups. What I realized over time is that most of the things people say are `genetic` or `impossible to learn` are actually just really really HARD. Most people try something for 2 weeks, don't see immediate results, and quit while thinking they don’t have the talent for it. The difference between successful people and everyone else isn't genetic; it's the ability to wake up, be a LION, and work hard. If you're relatively smart and willing to work extremely hard, you can brute force your way to becoming skilled at nearly anything. There's a lion in everyone bro.",4w,886,83,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo
"You can have pretty much everything you want in life, as long as you 1) take risks and ignore what society tells you 2) work hard You want to be tall, jacked, and handsome? OK BET, get limb-lengthening surgery, take steroids, and get plastic surgery from a good surgeon. You might look at that and be disgusted, but really sit down and question why that disgusts you. Do you REALLY find it reprehensible to get cheek filler? Is that really much worse than being obese (normalized), playing video games 12 hours a day (normalized), or vaping (normalized)? Or is it just that society has told you these things are worse and you accept it as true? Many many people thought I was a weirdo at Columbia for constantly talking about wanting to build a startup. I've fully lost count of the number of times I've been called arrogant, narcissistic, cocky, delusional, etc. They're probably still calling me that on Sidechat. If I listened to the advice of these people, I'd be working today towards a life I did not want and would honestly be a loser. I'd have swallowed up my dreams, killed my ambition, and awkwardly agreed with everyone else: `haha yeah I was just joking! please accept me again! I'm a spineless loser who can't think for himself and be vocal about his thoughts and opinions!` So corny. If you can ignore the opinions of others, take big risks, and know EXACTLY what you're looking for, you can get everything you want in life. Know what you're looking for, and every once in a while, pause and reflect on whether you're actually working towards what you want.

"A startup truth I disagree with is that you shouldn't pay high cash comp. Cluely pays $250–350K base for designers and $300K–$1M base for engineers, and I'm certain this will be the new normal. Traditionally, the idea was to pay everyone below market, give them a tiny bit more equity, sell them on the `mission`, and hope they stick around. Here's why everyone is wrong (except me and Zuck): 1) You don’t need 100 people anymore. You need a few killers who move insanely fast. If you hire right and prioritize well, you can hit $10M ARR in under six months with under 20 people. 2) `Believe in the mission” is ALWAYS cope. You're 7 pivots deep into your `mission,` and I'm highly skeptical of every company mission. > Zuckerberg didn't dream of Meta -- he was a nerdy engineer who found something that worked and doubled down infinitely. > Larry and Sergey didn't dream of Google -- they found an interesting algorithm and doubled down infinitely > Early Airbnb employees were not putting their lives on the line to find better transportation accommodations for people at conferences. People never ever stay for the `mission,` but they MIGHT stay for the culture↓ 3) The only truly sticky part of an early stage startup for employees is how unique the culture and team is. There are many people who hate on Cluely , but one thing anyone will agree on is that if you ARE looking for a place like Cluely, you will not be able to find it anywhere else in the world. We work 12 hours a day, sponsor free Hinge premium, expense ALL dates, have a house full of influencers, and film content every single day. 4) You need risk/reward calculations to make sense if you expect 110% commitment. If the company goes well, founders will make 10-100x what the founding engineers make. You can't always bump upside; there's only so much equity in the company. But you CAN remove downside. And if you want everyone in the company to work as hard as you, you should. 5) There are very few winners in the startup space, and without exception, winning companies are built by the best people. If you want to win, you must be elite at everything. Including comp. Finally, most startup advice is garbage and you shouldn't listen to it (including this). What worked for anyone might not work for you, and spending 4 hours a day watching YC podcasts or re-reading Zero to One isn't going to help you. Everyone is wrong except you.

"If you don’t understand power laws, you will never build a successful startup. Here’s what I mean: In startups (and life), power laws dominate everything— the top 1% of actions create 99% of outcomes. These actions are so important that if you haven’t found them yet, your only job should be to find them. If you have, your only job is to double down. But most founders don’t do this. They get stuck chasing incremental, 10-20% improvements in random areas… and never find the things that actually meaningfully grow their company. When building Cluely , we ignored these small improvements and hunted exclusively for massive, needle-moving wins. This allowed us to focus our attention on finding the few bets that mattered most, and it’s paid off significantly: - 1% of our product ideas drove 99% of retention - 1% of our UGC creators generated 99% of views - 1% of our viral moments earned 99% of consumer mindshare Looking back, this is arguably the most important concept I’ve learned from building startups, and I look for it everywhere now. Every single experiment we conduct, I think about whether it has the potential to yield power law outcomes if proven correct. Will throwing a $1.5 million rave potentially yield power law outcomes in midnshare? Maybe. Will hiring a single world-class designer for $300k base salary result in potential power law outcomes in conversion? Perhaps. If you’re stuck optimizing things that won’t fundamentally move your company forward, stop. You don't need better optimization. You need a few massive wins. When something works, it'll be really obvious.",1m,624,73,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo

"6 months ago, I was NOT tuff. I had tried and failed at 3 different startups, was making no money, had ZERO (0) girls in my DM's, got rejected from the ASIAN frat because they thought I was weird, and the ratio at my birthday party was 1:4 (not tuff). I was stuck in this weird loop where I believed I would become successful, but had pretty much zero proof to show for it. Today, Cluely has raised over $20M backed by some of the biggest investors in the world, and has a genuine shot at being one of the fastest growing startups in the world. The past few months have FULLY changed my life, and it’s all happened incredibly quickly. Looking back, I think it’s a huge testament to one simple belief that I’ve developed: If you take big risks and work hard, the world will reward you. When you're unsuccessful, it can feel like success is impossibly far away. But the truth is, it can be a lot closer than you think. The successful people you see aren't actually as special as you think (me included). We just chose to make the risky decisions and commit fully - something that 99.999% of people don't do.

As a consumer, I wasted dozens of hours talking to reps who either didn’t know what they were doing—or didn’t have the product knowledge to actually help.

"In the past week at Cluely , we kicked off a project that will change the course of AI. Here’s why: Every major AI model today shares the same two flaws: - They wait to be prompted instead of predicting the information you need. - They operate on very little context, usually restricted to text only. Instead, Cluely proactively surfaces the most useful prompts for you based on what you’re seeing, hearing, saying, and doing. And now, for the first time, we have the data to train models around this entirely new UX: a proactive AI instead of a reactive one. We're not building models to answer your questions. We're building  models that will predict which questions you have.

"Being around ambitious people will change your life. Earlier this year, I hosted a 3-day hacker retreat with 15 of the most talented builders at Columbia: Hackshack ( www.cuhackshack.com ) The premise was simple: Who can make the most money in one weekend? When I organized this, I’d just launched Interview Coder (cheating tool for technical interviews) and had grown to a 5-figure MRR in 9 days. I hosted this event because I wanted to surround myself with hyper-ambitious people who’d push me to take my startup to the next level. Surprisingly, it only took a couple of days in that environment to realize I’d been thinking way too small. The breakthrough came when I realized Interview Coder's core technology (an on-screen, undetectable AI) had massive potential beyond technical interviews. That sparked the idea for Cluely , the most ambitious version of Interview Coder that aims to redefine how people interact with AI. It’s been two months since launch, and we’ve already hit major revenue milestones ($6M ARR) and raised over $20M. If I hadn't deliberately created this high-intensity environment, none of this would have ever happened. Take this as a reminder: If you're ambitious, focus on surrounding yourself with other ambitious, high-agency people. The rest will figure itself out.",1m,978,36,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo
"PSA: Being “professional” is killing your company. In the past 2 months, Cluely has grown to $6M in revenue by ditching the idea that you need to be professional. When we launched Interview Coder (initial version of Cluely), we leaned into the controversial nature of it and used it to funnel our growth. When I got kicked out of Columbia, I publicized everything and went viral. Since then, we’ve spent millions on wild marketing stunts, hired some of the most unhinged influencers on the internet, and taken bigger risks than anyone else in our space. And that’s the whole point: If no one’s paying attention to your product, it might as well not exist. While most companies are busy being “respectable,” the ones that win are the ones willing to truly do different and authentic things. You’re already seeing the shift: → Elon Musk tweeting whatever he wants → Sperm Racing raising $1M+ and having a shot at becoming a real sport → Engineers in sweatpants building billion-dollar companies People aren’t craving another corporate brand; they’re craving authentic people who do interesting things. No one in the world ever thought, `I wish this company was less interesting and the founder was less honest.` If you’re building a company today, stop worrying about your reputation – and start focusing on getting attention.

"Cluely 's interns make between $50/hour to $200/hour. Here’s why you should be paying your interns more money: In the past two months since launch, our interns have helped us scale to $6M ARR. They’ve gotten millions of views on social media, managed a crazy marketing budget, and helped us solve some of our hardest technical challenges. This wasn't an accident. It's what happens when you: - Hire extremely talented people - Pay them what they're actually worth - Hold them to super high standards I've never understood founders who expect 12-hour days and exceptional results from interns while paying them minimum wage. If you're underpaying high-performing interns, you're actively sabotaging your company's potential – and not saving your company much money. People work harder when they’re paid what they’re worth.

"Cluely (almost) got sued… After getting kicked out of Columbia and building an AI “cheating” tool, we’ve been in multiple situations where we could've had lawsuits thrown at us. Despite this, we've broken $6M ARR and are growing faster than ever. Looking back, this was mainly possible because of one person: Our lawyer. Kevin Cergol-Plotkin makes up the entire legal team at Cluely, and he’s gotten us out of ~5 insane lawsuits in the past 2 months. He’s hands-down the best lawyer I’ve ever worked with (or seen) and is extremely diligent with his work. If you’re trying to build a startup and need legal help, I couldn’t recommend anyone more.

"Cluely gives every employee free HingeX (highest tier subscription). Every company would perform better if their employees weren’t single. When you’re single (and lonely), you simply can’t get work done efficiently. I speak from experience: The worst time of my life was when I got rescinded from Harvard and spent a year locked in my room, not speaking to anyone outside of my immediate family. I became super lonely and started losing my motivation to do anything meaningful. Having a partner would’ve solved this. When your employees aren’t lonely, they’ll work harder and be happier.

"I’ve gone to community college, had my Harvard admission revoked, and gotten kicked out of Columbia. Here’s why I think college is a joke: - Everyone “cheats” When I was at Columbia, I used ChatGPT to cheat on pretty much every assignment – and I wasn’t alone. I never met a single student who didn’t use AI to get through their classes. The information you get with a “college education” is becoming increasingly irrelevant. - Admissions are a lottery I think it’s pretty clear that admissions promote diversity over true merit. The greatest example of this I’ve seen is from Zach Yadegari (18 y.o. with a 4.0 GPA & $30M ARR business who got rejected by 15/18 top colleges). There are countless stories like his that show how meaningless a college acceptance really is. - Top talent can be found anywhere Elite schools love to brand themselves as the birthplace for people who change the world. The truth is, the most talented people I’ve seen (and hired) didn’t come from prestigious universities – one of our best engineers is a random furry I met in community college. Talented people can be found anywhere, and your school name shouldn’t dictate where you’re able to work or your potential for success. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: You go to college to find a co-founder and a wife. That’s it. P.S.

"A year ago, I sent an email that changed the course of my life… After getting rejected from Nucleus Genomics for a SWE internship, I cold-emailed the CEO and offered to work for free. He said yes. That summer changed everything. For the first time in my life, I saw people my age building things that I didn’t even know were possible. Before that, I assumed I’d just take the safe route and get a full-time job in tech. But doing that single internship gave me the confidence to pursue building something of my own. Fast forward a year – I’m now building Cluely , one of the fastest-growing AI startups in the world. If I hadn’t taken the time to send that cold email, none of this would’ve happened.

"Announcing Cluely 's $15M fundraise, led by Andreessen Horowitz . I started this company three months ago with my best friend Neel Shanmugam and my roommate Alex Chen . Since then, we've done over a billion impressions across social media and generated millions of dollars in revenue. Cluely started as a tool to cheat on technical interviews. I used it to get offers at top tech companies, like Amazon, Meta, Tiktok, and Capital One. After posting about it publicly to market the tool, I got blacklisted from big tech and kicked out of Columbia University. But I immediately realized that the technology we built wasn't just a great tool for cheating on technical interviews; it's likely the future of how humans will interact with AI. Today, people are using Cluely in sales calls, meetings, recruiting, and so much more. The potential for AI is limited because it's stuck behind a chatbot. We're just getting started.

"I’m building the future of AI with Cluely. In <2 months since our launch, we’ve scaled to over $5M ARR. If you’re scared of AI replacing your job, here are two things I recommend: 1) Take more risks. I don’t know what the world is going to look like in 5 years. Nobody does. But I do know that AI is quickly giving everyone access to the same tools, code, and creative shortcuts. This means that you if you want to set yourself apart, you need to be willing to take risks. Every single piece of success I’ve had over the past few months has come from trusting my gut when everyone else told me not to. 2) Learn how to go viral. AI makes it easier than ever to replicate products. What’s hard now is getting attention. That’s what people mean when they say “distribution is the last moat”. When we were brainstorming our first product (Interview Coder), we thought about what kind of product would go viral – and worked backwards. This strategy worked extremely well, and helped us break over $3M in ARR after getting hundreds of millions of views on social media. If you can learn to take massive risks and get the right people to see it, I genuinely believe the AI era will become the most rewarding time for you to be alive. P.S. If you want to see what the future of AI looks like, go here: https://cluely.com/",2m,323,15,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo
"I asked over 40 strangers to start a company with me before I met my co-founder… Here’s the story of how I met Neel: When I first transferred to Columbia (Fall 2024) I went up to every single person that I thought looked smart and asked them if they wanted to be my co-founder. I got tons of weird looks, “no’s”, and people telling me they weren’t interested. Neel was one of them. It was only after meeting again at a party that we started working together on small side projects (notetaking app, AI agent for liquor distributors etc) and realized we worked surprisingly well together. Eventually, we both decided that working a corporate job wasn’t for us and went all-in on startups. We launched Interview Coder (AI for cheating on technical interviews), farmed a ton of big-tech offers to go viral, and hit $1M ARR in 36 days. After that, we decided to build something much bigger. That’s when Cluely was born – an undetectable desktop assistant that feeds you answers in real time. It’s been under 2 months, and we already broke $5M in revenue and are on pace to become the fastest company to ever hit $100M ARR. Shoutout Neel 🫡 P.S. I partly made this post because he’s desperately single.

"Earlier this year, I got kicked out of Columbia University , blacklisted at Amazon , and was questioning everything… For about a month. When I launched Interview Coder (AI for cheating on technical interviews), I live-recorded using it to pass my Amazon interviews, hoping it would go viral. It didn’t. The video flopped, Amazon rescinded my offer, and they contacted Columbia asking them to kick me out (which they eventually did). At this point, everyone in my life (including my co-founder) was telling me it wasn’t worth it to continue. This was probably the most stressful month of my life. I had no idea if things were going to work out, but I decided to listen to a voice in my head that was telling me to keep going. Soon after, Interview Coder went mega viral when I posted Columbia’s disciplinary notice online. We got millions of views on social media, broke 1M in revenue, and were later able to use the virality to springboard the launch of Cluely , our biggest bet in AI. Our vision is to create the ultimate desktop assistant, allowing you to directly integrate AI into sales meetings, video calls, and more. Since launching less than 2 months ago, we’ve gotten over 70,000 active users and hit $5M ARR. If there’s something I learned, it’s that you need to really swing big if you want a big result. Cutting off all my other opportunities (college, big-tech, etc) was the biggest risk I’d taken at the time, and I’m more glad than ever that I went all in. P.S.

This is the one thing that can separate a bad applicant from a good one and is the sole reason for over half of the invites I've sent. >99% of applicants have a completely horrible Github that is just unhireable. - Amazon hires a ton of people.

We believe AI is not a threat to human potential: it’s the greatest amplifier we’ve ever seen. This is the future we’re building. And we’re just getting started. → [ https://lnkd.in/gnHY_kQA ]",4m,2723,168,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo
"i got kicked out of Columbia for building Interview Coder , AI to cheat on coding interviews. now i raised $5.3 million to build Cluely , a cheating tool for literally everything. a completely undetectable AI that sees your screen, hears your audio, and gives you real-time assistance in any situation. interviews, assignments, tests, sales calls, meetings — everything. and tbh, i don't think this is cheating. every single time technology has made people smarter, the world panics. then it adapts. then it forgets. and suddenly, it's normal. but this is different. humanity is at an inflection point. AI will transform the entire world, and it will be more disruptive than anything we've ever seen. Cluely is the bridge to a world where humans don't compete with machines — we grow with them.",4m,6691,411,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo
"Cluely launches in <24 hours. We're changing the definition of the word `cheating.` Interview Coder broke every technical recruiting pipeline in the world. But what AI enables isn't just a transformation of technical interviews. It will redefine how our world works, upend every social structure, rewrite the rules of morality. Cluely is the most ambitious project of my life. If we can accomplish what we set out to, we will change the course of human history. 4/20/25 2PM PST",4m,2017,105,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo
"Cluely is the last project I will ever work on. Building Interview Coder was one of the most stressful and fulfilling experiences of my life. After I launched, there was a period of about 4 weeks where both Columbia and Amazon were upset with me, and I thought I'd blown up my entire career + education for nothing. After it went viral, I learned one very simple truth: you need to swing big to win. Cluely is the most ambitious version of Interview Coder , and will redefine the way that humans experience AI. Launching 4/20 at 2PM EST.",4m,1407,54,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo
"I scaled Interview Coder to $3M in annual recurring revenue in <3 months by going viral—recording myself passing an Amazon interview using the tool and getting kicked out of Columbia for it. Here are my thoughts on growth and marketing as an early-stage consumer startup: My core thesis is that the only thing that works at this stage is ORGANIC VIRALITY. You simply don't have the capital or recognition to get attention any other way. Nobody's watching your podcast, nobody's reading your newsletter, nobody's reading your lameass tweets (yes, YOUR lameass tweets), and you can't afford ads. The only thing that matters is top-of-funnel, so you MUST do something that goes viral. There seem to be only 2 ingredients to this: 1) Viral sense. If you don't have it, it will be hard to go viral. You need to scroll. If you're under 25 and spend a few hours a day online, you probably have it. If you're older or less chronically online, you probably don't. 2) Post quantity. You just need to post enough. If you have viral sense and are posting consistently, you will make it. Everyone says distribution is the last moat, but if you truly internalized this, you'd be posting. A better top-of-funnel is more profitable than the most highly converting, beautiful landing page in the world. In my case, I knew that by recording myself using Interview Coder to pass an Amazon interview and sharing the controversy of getting kicked out of Columbia, the story would spread. I blew up my entire career and education to force this to work and it paid off in a big way. And in all honesty, I don't think there is a universe where this story didn't blow up. At the early stage, especially as a younger founder, you should be more confident in your ability to market virally than in your product being the next Airbnb or Uber. Build with virality in mind, trust your instincts, and TAKE MORE RISKS.",4m,1559,87,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo
We just shipped the BIGGEST UPDATE to Interview Coder in history. New features: Click-through overlay: No more mouse-off-screen tracking. No other software has this. Problem analysis: Auto-generates clarifying questions + edge case breakdowns. Dry test runs: Code walkthroughs in comments to prove your solution works. It's insane how slow big tech is to move. This software is still unpatched and completely undetectable.

"I just got kicked out of Columbia for taking a stand against Leetcode interviews. Here’s the whole story: In Fall 2024, I transferred into Columbia as a CS major. I came in knowing I wanted to start a company and immediately found a great co-founder in Neel Shanmugam A few early projects didn’t go anywhere. After a while, we realized something important: We didn’t need a better product. We needed distribution. So we flipped the usual startup model on its head and decided to just build something we knew would go viral first, focusing on distribution before anything. That's how we came up with Interview Coder — an invisible application that helps you pass Leetcode interviews The plan was to use it ourselves, get offers from top companies, film everything, and ride the shock factor. We built the MVP in 10 days and launched it free + open source on LinkedIn. It got a few views, but it didn’t go hyper viral. Still, we had a gut feeling this idea had legs. So we used the whole recruiting season to polish it. Eventually, I got offers from Meta, TikTok, and Capital One. We launched on LinkedIn again, this time with actual results — and the response was bigger. I went too far when I posted all the offers as job experience. That got my old account banned from LinkedIn— and from many subreddits we were relying on for growth. But by that point, I had what I needed. We recorded the entire Amazon process — every step of me using InterviewCoder from OA to final offer. The UX was clean. The results were real. I posted the video. It started to blow up. Then Columbia sent me a disciplinary notice. Apparently, an Amazon executive had sent the school a letter saying something to the effect of: “Expel this kid or we won’t hire from your school again.” I was told not to share the letter, but at that point, I had two choices: → Stay quiet and get buried (Columbia would surely have sided with Amazon to kick me out) → Or go public and fight I leaked the letter, and it went super viral on X. That single moment probably protected me more than anything else. At the hearing, Columbia forced me into a weird admission that the tool could be used to help students cheat in a Columbia CS class. (It can’t.) and put me on academic probation, scheduling another hearing for leaking all the documents. A week and a half later, and I'm completely kicked out from school. LOL! It's funny now and an amazing story in hindsight, but the truth is I was tweaking bad throughout this entire process. Taking this much risk tested my mental strength to its absolute limit, but I'm super glad I did it. Interview Coder still works, and we just pushed the biggest update to it ever for maximal undetectability. More soon.",5m,67092,3,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo
"Eliam got the ball rolling on a lot of stuff for me and Neel. Big dreams start with a first believer. If you’re working on side projects and have even the tiniest bit of delusion/fear that consulting or IB might not be the future for you, I’d highly recommend talking to Eliam. Interview Coder started out as a fun side project and Eliam was one of the first people to pounce on it (and us) and encourage us to take it somewhere. The smallest ideas can lead to the biggest companies. Would recommend a conversation if you’re at Columbia and tinkering.",5m,128,4,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-lee-goat?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAFdZSTQB7UqPnQv0aRN1T6Rg0w2FIav1FYo
