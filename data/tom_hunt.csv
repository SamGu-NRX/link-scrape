"`Are we going to be made redundant?` I had to address AI concerns in our team meeting. It's a valid question. Up until a couple of months ago, we were dipping our toes. Now we're diving in. It's understandable why there is concern. This was my answer: `One of the reasons Fame has grown is that we use technology like the internet to save time (automation) and lower costs and increase value of our service (remote work). This means we can beat competitors that don't use technology like the internet. I see AI as a technology that will have the same, if not bigger impact than the internet. Existing/new competitors will start using AI in the same way we used the internet to beat older competitors, they will beat us if we don‚Äôt adopt it at the same rate/faster than them. If it happens at all, then this is the reason why people could be made redundant: the business shrinks due to clients leaving/not joining due to competitors being better. I am confident that if we all learn how to use AI well, we become much more valuable to Fame and to any other businesses we work with in the future. We are heading in the direction of more AI use, but you have my word that no one will be made redundant due to AI.` Calling all people-first businesses...

"It's 15 minutes into our second date... She drops the magical sentence: `I'm from a small village in the south of Italy, and there's a bar in our building.` `A bar like a cocktail bar?` I ask naively. `No, an Italian bar.` Of course, I later learn that in Italy, a bar is what we would call a coffee shop. I'm hooked. 20 years ago, we're Interrailing in Europe and arrive in Venice after an overnight train from Milan. We head to the first `caf√©,` and I remember the suave Italian guy standing at the espresso bar, sipping espresso: - Where is the rest of his coffee? - Why is he standing up? The Italian bar is very different from the English coffee shop, where people sit down, talk in hushed voices, and don't make eye contact. It's also a place where Italian people engage in one of their national activities: chatting. I say chatting; most British people would describe it as shouting. `Buongiorno!` `Tutto a posto?` `Stai zitto!` Fast forward to today, it's 6:54 AM, and Bar Il Cavallo is thriving: - The espresso is served darker than diesel - Italian bangers are booming - There are fresh pastries As I'm at the bar ordering un caff√®, one of Tiziana 's cousins arrives with his friend... `Posso pagare con loro?` I ask the barista. This is a game the people here like to play: secretly paying for each other's espresso. The coffee is delivered and they try to pay. They're shocked.

"The light has a different quality here. It shimmers across the vines. And life seems a little slower, compared to London anyway. The people seem to care about different things. Slower things like friends, family and the moment. On baby time, we arrive at a wine bar much earlier than the typical French person. The owner isn't hunched over a spreadsheet or polishing glasses, he's sat having a beer with an old friend. Initially he says food will be served at 7pm (we arrive at 5pm), but after some small talk, he brings out the terrine maison and a Saint-Marcellin cheese with some bread. He even brings out a tarte once we're done (on the house). And the champagne‚Ä¶ These are the only vines that can legally produce champagne, and the CIVC (Comit√© Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne) even regulates how those vines can be pruned. The second fermentation (to get the bubbles) happens in the bottle it's sold in, but they have to turn the bottle for weeks, then freeze the neck of the bottle to shoot out the sediment. The CIVC is so protective of the process they mount legal challenge to any other product that tries to bear the name. We order a glass at a local Lyon wine bar, 5 minutes later the waiter comes out to offer a better one as our choice wasn't cold enough. They just couldn't serve it warm. Nothing should compromise quality. Like the place. I understand why people retire here, and why people say America is the place to make money whilst Europe is the place to spend money.

"I grew Fame from $0-$4M ARR in 5 years, $0 raised. Here are the 7 biggest mistakes I made: 1. Didn't Focus Revenue Level: 120k ARR I had no idea Fame would become Fame. So I was doing 5 things on the side, a SaaS here, a newsletter there. If I forgot those and doubled down, maybe we would be at $4m in 3 years, instead of 5. 2. Didn't Hire Fast Enough Revenue Level: $1m ARR Once things started working, I thought `I am so amazing`, I need to do all the work. I was selling, hiring, improving processes and delivering. All poorly. I needed to hire others faster. 3. Delayed A Robust Performance Management Process Revenue Level: $2.5m ARR When you get to 30 people, especially if it's your first business, it's likely that some of the 30 aren't right. But what do you do? You keep them, it impacts the whole team. To get the wrong people off the bus, you need a robust performance management process, we didn't have one. 4. Got Distracted By AI Revenue Level: $2.8m ARR 2021, GPT3 is released. We're very excited. Built a tool called Abney to convert podcast episodes to written assets (blog posts etc). It worked great, but I under-estimated the time and energy needed to create an sell another product service. Should have just kept it in house like it eventually turned out to be (now called Fame AI). 5. Tried To Un-Niche Revenue Level: $3m ARR As my LinkedIn profile blew up, I got to confident... why don't we do this for clients? So I planned to broaden Fame from `b2b podcast agency` to `b2b content agency`. In short, it didn't work. It takes a lot of time and energy to make a new service as good as the one you have been improving for the last 4 years. 6. Spent Too Much On Outbound Revenue Level: $3.5m ARR Getting outbound to work is expensive: you need the outbound system, and then you need the sales people that have the skillset. We invested a little, then more, then more. And ultimately never got it to work. It's hard to convince a big B2B business to start a podcast if they don't want to. 7. Dropped Prices Revenue Level: $0-$4m ARR Tariffs hit, new sales slowed, so we panicked and dropped prices. One month later new sales had gone up, didn't need to panic and take the margin hit.

We like the carrot: Here's what we're trying to achieve This is what we would love you to achieve If we achieve this, here's why it will be good for you, our clients and the business Having your team focus on the things you want, decreases the chance you get the things you don't want. The things that may get people `fired`? They melt away, leaving a high performance, people first culture.

Hiring legends is step 1. These legends will be: - Leave - Useless - Unhappy If you don't get the first 4 weeks right. Primacy bias: the tendency to more easily recall information that we encounter first. E.g. they won't forget if your onboarding is weak. Here's 7 things we learnt after onboarding approx. 200 legends: 1. Balance structure and free time 2. Assign a buddy 3. Get face time with the CEO 4. Update your documentation 5. Test and givde feedback 6. Meet daily for the first week 7. Control the firehose Stop expecting people to `figure it out`.

"If I were launching a new biz, I‚Äôd make this hire first. Before anyone... A content person. Specifically, a social content person. Why? Marketing is changing: - Cost per clicks are increasing - Who knows what's happening with SEO - Outbound is being ignored Building an organic social audience of your ideal buyer is high leverage, but takes time. So need to get that flywheel started early. At the early stage, you also need to learn from your ideal customers (obvious), the best way to do this fast is to build a social audience (not so obvious). Social comes first, then the email newsletter, then the podcast. In short: Content provides the feedback you need to build an awesome product Content helps you sell the product Who would you hire first?",3m,270,196,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhuntio?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXth68BPjXrbCWKVEpQg1k0lVDiHAyD_ek

We get customers at a fraction of the cost. Enabling us to lower prices, increasing retention (the foundation of growth).

"Fame's EBIDTA margin is up 40% YoY. Here's how... Your business is an organism. And inefficient organisms die. (Or at least, are less profitable.) Yet, humans invented something called management, which allows us to increase efficiency. Most organisms can't do this. Here are three things we've optimised: 1 - Focus First define the Primary Role Objective for the role. This must tie to the mission of the business. As we focus on client success and happiness, all our management roles have objectives that tie to that. For example: - Automation Master: to save the team time so they can focus on making clients successful (and happy). - Head of Audio & Video Content: to create awesome audio and video assets that make clients successful (and happy). - Head of Written Content: to create awesome written assets that make clients happy. There will then likely be 1-2 tasks that this person can do in their role that will have the biggest impact on the Primary Role Objective. You then set up a 30 minute weekly meeting with each manager... and the first thing on the agenda is an update on those two tasks. This doesn't change. It's consistent. E.g. you are consistently reminding this team member that their role exists to perform those 1-2 tasks and they are first thing they should think about when they start work. 2 - Documentation Yawn, I know. But every management role MUST have a `Role Working Procedure`. This describes (in the right amount of detail) what this person does. It enables us to have extreme clarity in how this person should spend their time. We put the 1-2 priorities at the top of the working procedure. It also doubles as the guide for others to use when this person either leaves or goes on holiday. 3 - Bloat Theory The third law of thermodynamics states that entropy of a closed system always increases over time. Your Role Working Procedures are not immune to this. Things will get added. And they will add little value to the business. E.g. they are inefficient. To counter this: set up a monthly agenda item to review and trim the Role Working Procedure to ensure it only includes tasks that will impact the business. There we go. If you are managing management spend, test out these three steps... and watch business efficiency (in other words: profit) fly.",6m,181,117,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhuntio?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXth68BPjXrbCWKVEpQg1k0lVDiHAyD_ek

"We got a backlink from Google. (It's do_follow) Yep, the people who invented the term... just linked to us. Here's how: In our quest to become the biggest and best B2B podcast agency, we look to eradicate any unnesscary costs. As lower costs = lower price = a more valuable service. One of those costs is podcast hosting. E.g. someone has to pay for the podcast audio files to fly around the world to listener devices. Most podcast agencies buy these hosting services from other providers. We built our own. It's called Fame Host. Most clients opt to use this. Besides reducing costs, Fame Host also enables Service Led Growth. E.g. getting exposure to potential customers from existings ones. Each podcast hosted on Fame Host produces a mini podcast website, with a page for each episode which is automatically shared with the guest. In this example, the guest likely updated their Google Research profile with a link to their episode. The guest looks good. The client saves money. Fame get's the exposure.

"They only wanted more hours. No complaints about: - Culture - Pay - Management The Lychee team just wanted to create more clips. So that became my job... Here's what we're doing about it: 1. Outbound One of the reasons for buying Lychee is that they have proven an outbound process (I can't share details I'm afraid), so we got that rolling straight away. 2. Cross-selling We then started creating clips for Fame clients, either as part of the Fame service or as a potential upsell. We also added the Lychee service as a down-sell in Fame's sales process. For example, a lead who may not be able to afford the full Fame service may want to use Lychee for their clips. This immediately increased volume through the system, making the Lychee team happier. 3. PLG Tools. Lychee built three awesome PLG tools that we immediately transitioned over to Fame: - Apple Podcasts to mp3 converter - Spotify Podcast to mp3 converter - X Spaces to mp3 converter These are used hundreds of times per day... Fame is now picking up these leads. We also added a single email to pitch our¬†2-Hour Podcast course to all leads, it's picked up a couple of sales.

"Sales funnels are back. What used the be the remit of shady online marketers... Are back on trend. One of the reasons we bought¬†Lychee¬†was because they had three tools that were generating approx. 300 leads a day: - Spotify podcast downloader - Apple podcast downloader - Spaces downloader Someone can paste a link into any of those, and then they get an email with a link to the mp3. The first learning here is that this was great work from the Lychee team: 1. See what people are searching for that relates to their product 2. Build the thing 3. Get it to rank Check out the first image below to see what happened to our SEO when we moved them over: But now of course those things have a cost e.g. AWS, API costs and the cost to build them. So, the Lychee team added a paywall for people who tried to use any of the tools more than once per month. This now generates over $1k MRR. These tools were already profitable, so the goodwill and brand awareness was a bonus. For example, if 300 people (who could be customers) per day start to know, like, and trust Fame, that should have a positive impact in the future. But what else could we be doing with this qualified traffic? We have two opportunities: - The thank you page - The email list Once someone has submitted their link for conversion, the next page shows the CTA to subscribe... this makes sense. E.g. the best upsell is often more of what someone has already bought. But then three days later we now are sending all leads an email with a CTA to our¬†2 Hour Podcast¬†course for $247. We made the first sale yesterday, an additional $247 in profit. All whilst gaining brand awareness and adding value to people who could be Fame customers in the future. We could either bank the profit or re-invest it back into optimising the funnel by looking at: - How much traffic we put in - How much value we add - How much value we can capture Sales funnels are so back.",9m,228,153,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhuntio?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXth68BPjXrbCWKVEpQg1k0lVDiHAyD_ek

"The deal is now signed, cash is transferred. What next? Integration‚Ä¶ My theory: Changing the ownership of a business is a big enough shock. And shocking something that's profitable, isn‚Äôt a good idea. We want to keep it profitable. Thus, we want to change as little else as possible in the short term. In addition: need to get the comms right. The biggest profitability driver is likely the people in the business. So you need to: - Be honest - Communicate that nothing will change in the short term (apart from ownership) - Sweeten the deal On sweetening the deal, is there anything that can be done to make the deal better for the people: - Payrise? - New bonus structure? - Less work? Speaking to as many new team members as possible is also great.

"10m impressions. 70k likes. 5k comments. 2k reposts. Last week, a post about ‚Äúcancelling a 1-1‚Äù popped off. But why? What makes a LinkedIn post go viral? Let‚Äôs find out... First, you need the following three things: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Copywriting skills 2Ô∏è‚É£ Consistent posting (for years) 3Ô∏è‚É£ A good close-up pic (with sunglasses, see example below) But some people have all these and still struggle to get above 1k likes. What are they missing? The secret sauce. Let's have a little algo lesson: - LinkedIn wants to show engaging content to users, so more users use LinkedIn, bringing more ad revenue - One of the most powerful algo signals e.g. a thing that tells the algo if a post is engaging users: is comments - Specifically, long comments from people outside of your network, as this shows the algo that people are engaging (not because they know you) - When the algo notices that a post is getting a high number of these comments, it will keep pushing it to new users as long as it continues to generate comments So to go viral, we need to get a load of people that don't know us, to write long comments on our post! How? We use the `challenge an obvious belief` method. For example, we may state something as fact that is wrong or more nuanced than we make it out to be. If we do this, we will allow people in the niche to come and prove us wrong (in the comments). They get to look intelligent in front of their peers, we get the attention. It's a great deal.

"The most common question I get in LinkedIn DM‚Äôs: ‚ÄúHow do I get my first B2B customers?‚Äù Let‚Äôs address this once and for all‚Ä¶ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Your Network You have goodwill with these people, so they are willing to take the risk based on their previous experience with you. You are early and unproven, so there is a significant risk of a potential customer losing time/money, so going cold won't work. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Decrease Risk As you start selling to your network, you decrease the perceived risk of buying from you by creating bottom-of-the-funnel content based on the success you have with these early customers. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Content After you have exhausted your network, you need to start expanding your ‚Äúsurface area‚Äù. E.g. the number of people who know you. These people haven‚Äôt worked with you before like those from Step 1, but you now have de-risked during Step 2, so it can start to work. How? A. Start creating content B. Start meeting people that have an audience of your ideal customer You pick the social network where most of your ideal customers are and start creating and posting content about things they‚Äôre interested in (not about your product). If you do this well, people will start to come inbound. To speed up growth, you need to start meeting people that have an audience of the people you want to reach. The best way to do this is to start talking about the things you‚Äôre posting about but in long form with these people. E.g. a podcast. If you are nice and interesting, they will give that co-created piece of content more exposure. The bonus: long-form content is recycled into more short-form content for the social platforms. And the content flywheel has started‚Ä¶ P.S. This is why we started Fame . To help you build your content flywheel, to bring in a stream of qualified customers, without spending a shed load on ads.

Then it‚Äôs their job to work out the ‚Äúhow‚Äù. 2. Set a reporting structure You don‚Äôt want to have to ping your team to get progress updates.

He joins Confessions of a B2B Entrepreneur to share all‚Ä¶ We cover: - What his day-to-day looks like - Why he builds (instead of buys) businesses - Why he‚Äôs sharing everything on the journey Full episode is linked in the comments below üëá,1y,210,62,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhuntio?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXth68BPjXrbCWKVEpQg1k0lVDiHAyD_ek
"He edited the first podcast I ever released. It‚Äôs 2016. And he delivers note-perfect audio each time, with a smile. That business (and podcast) died and I moved to a new role, started another pod, and brought Spartak along. Again, perfect audio, delivered every time. But one day, replies started slowing down‚Ä¶ and the audio quality dropped a little. A few months later, everything was back to normal and the podcast was starting to perform. Then I get a message on Slack: `Tom, this is Olha, Spartak's wife Spartak died a week ago.` Here's what happened: Spartak and Olha were living together. They were working together using Spartak‚Äôs accounts. Olha communicated with clients, and Spartak edited audio. But Spartak was also teaching Olha how to edit. And then Olha started to take on some of his work, from Spartak's Slack/Trello accounts. She asked if she could continue working with us. `Of course,` we said. That was back in 2020. Since then, she has edited hundreds, if not thousands of podcast episodes for us. Originally Ukrainian, Olha has now found a new home in Turkey. And the quality of her work and collaboration only continue to level up, helping us scale from 0 to 100 clients. If `someone` delivers great work with a smile, do you care who it is? Man or woman.

"I used to be a horrendous manager. Working as a supervisor at Starbucks in 2010, I had no idea what I was doing. Now‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm ok. Here are 7 things I‚Äôve learnt: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build structure Set your 1-1‚Äôs at the same time each week, have a standard agenda, and track actions. This means you and your team don‚Äôt need to interrupt each other every day, you know there is a standard time/place for management activities. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Encourage time off Working your team to the bone is short-term thinking. Build long-term teams. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt micromanage Allowing people to work out the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù or the ‚Äúhow‚Äù is empowering. They will repay you with productivity. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Choose when to meddle Meddling is sometimes required, but it has a cost. It reduces the confidence of your team. Meddle with caution. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Have robust performance management processes Give people the freedom to do their work. But if they aren‚Äôt a fit for the role, it‚Äôs better for you, them, and the business for them to move on. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Provide just enough growth Pushing people too hard e.g. giving them tasks too far ahead of their ability crushes confidence. Instead, give tasks just ahead of someone‚Äôs ability, and step in to help when they get stuck. 7Ô∏è‚É£ Work out where they are going Your job as a manager is to understand where your team want to get to in their career, and then help them get there. Whether that place is within your business or not.

"The Fame team generate 000s of LinkedIn impressions each month. And we have no rules. No one is chasing them to post. How? It‚Äôs the difference between power and force. Force: Most businesses try to force their team to get active on LinkedIn: - Mandating people to engage with the CEO‚Äôs or Company posts - Asking people to post once per month - Running a contest There are two issues here: 1. Using force doesn‚Äôt sustain behavioural change 2. Their LinkedIn presence does not belong to the business, it belongs to each team member So almost all ‚Äúemployee advocacy‚Äù campaigns fail. Power: I started posting 3 years ago‚Ä¶ and shared some of the results: - New hires generated - Increased learning - Clients attracted And slowly but surely others started to post. Then one day, William Riley suggested we start a Slack channel and invite others keen to post, into the channel. We did this, and I also offered to review any post before it goes live. In summary: - No mandating - No contest - No asking We have 17 people in that group, posting weekly about the things they love.

"I hacked LinkedIn Ads. And you can too‚Ä¶ In 6 simple steps: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Understand the algorithm LinkedIn Ads will give you cheap impressions if people read/like/comment on your ad. But until 6 months ago, this couldn‚Äôt be tested without paying. You would need to run 17 different variations. Now, with Employee Ads, you can test with every organic post. Which brings us to Step 2Ô∏è‚É£‚Ä¶ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sculpt an organic post We need to sculpt an organic post that: - Get‚Äôs engagement - Educates people about the problem that your product/service solves - Introduces a ‚Äúspicy narrative‚Äù You might not get it right the first time. But you can test. Here are some tips: - Spent 25% of the time on the hook - It should be a text post with an image of yourself - Separate sentences with line breaks - Cut out all filler words Start testing. 1 post per day. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cultivate engagement Once we have an organic post that is popping off‚Ä¶ We want to multiply engagement: - Ask questions in the comments - Reply to every comment right away - Get your team/family/friends to engage The more engagement, the more social proof we will have for Step 5Ô∏è‚É£. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Insert a CTA 24 hours later, when the engagement has died down. We now edit the end of the post to add a CTA. This can be a couple of lines of text and a link to the product/service that helps solve the problem detailed in the post. We do this because‚Ä¶ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run employee ads We can now boost this exact post (with the social proof) with LinkedIn Employee Ads. The ad will be shown from your personal profile, with a link to your Company Page. And we get to keep all that juicy social proof from Step 3Ô∏è‚É£ but WITH the direct CTA from Step 4Ô∏è‚É£. This is the hack. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Scale Here‚Äôs the fun part: If this ad pulls in profitable customers, you can run this ad forever. Conversions can be tracked with the LinkedIn Pixel. And if/when it does, you will also blow up: - Your personal profile - Your Company Page Short-term ROI. Long-term brand building. Magic.

"I closed $1,476,499 last year for my agency. Here‚Äôs the 7-step process: (we start and grow podcasts for B2B businesses) 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define a spicy narrative What do you believe that most people in your industry disagree with? And how does that connect to the problem that your product or service solves? This is your ‚Äúspicy narrative‚Äù. And it should blend into everything your business produces: - Website - Ad copy - Sales deck - Social content At Fame, we believe that interruption is the enemy, and that hashtag # b2b marketers should shift their budget from eBooks/trade shows/outbound to audience building. - It‚Äôs controversial - It educates our ideal buyers about the problem that our service solves What is the ‚Äúspicy narrative‚Äù for your business? 2Ô∏è‚É£ Distribute said narrative Now we need to ‚Äúspread the word‚Äù. There are many ways to do this: - SEO - Content - Paid Social - Google Ads - Trade Shows - Organic Social - Cold Outbound - Partners/Affiliates Start testing. Then double down on what works. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clear, easy CTA You need 1 CTA, not 7. We have one: ‚ÄúGet Proposal‚Äù. It should be all over your site. This is the goal of all efforts in Step 2Ô∏è‚É£. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Rapid response As soon as someone takes that action, you are being tested. - ‚ÄúAre they nice?‚Äù - ‚ÄúAre they smart?‚Äù - ‚ÄúDo they care about me?‚Äù These are the questions that prospects are asking themselves post-CTA. React FAST: - Auto-email with some personality explaining what will happen next - Manually send a connection request on LinkedIn - Deliver on the CTA Make sure the prospect knows you care. We send proposals out to qualified prospects in 24 hours. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Add value on sales calls The majority of sales calls won't convert. This is normal. But if you add value, you will gain an advocate. And it helps with the sale. It shows your expertise. Give away your wisdom for free. So ditch the script and: - Listen - Ask questions - Then share your wisdom And only then‚Ä¶ if it‚Äôs a fit, you start talking about you and what you do. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Remove all barriers Once the value has been shown, you remove all barriers to the sale: - Provide all the information they need - Provide client references - Respond FAST - Chase regularly - Jump on calls with other members of their team (if needed) Too many deals die due to unnecessary barriers. Not yours. 7Ô∏è‚É£ Nail onboarding As soon as the contract is signed, you are being tested (again). Buyer's remorse is real. You need to serve some dopamine ASAP. We send: - A welcome email with a custom welcome email - A physical welcome gift - Instructions with clear next steps I am then in the kick-off call so there is a familiar face, before the handoff to the accounts team. That‚Äôs the 7-step process. Recap: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define a spicy narrative 2Ô∏è‚É£ Distribute said narrative 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clear, easy CTA 4Ô∏è‚É£ Rapid response 5Ô∏è‚É£ Add value on sales calls 6Ô∏è‚É£ Remove all barriers 7Ô∏è‚É£ Nail onboarding Over to you.",1y,191,106,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhuntio?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXth68BPjXrbCWKVEpQg1k0lVDiHAyD_ek

"Presenteeism. Normalizing overwork. These are the most common characteristics of a toxic work culture.

"If I had to start from 0 to grow a B2B business‚Ä¶ Here's my plan. Hint: it doesn‚Äôt include: - eBooks - Trade shows - Cold outbound Let‚Äôs go: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Select an internal ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù People trust people more than brands. Forget your Company's LinkedIn Page. Select someone that: - Wants to be famous - Has good communication skills Typically this is: - The founder/CEO - Someone in sales/marketing/customer success 2Ô∏è‚É£ Define a spicy narrative What do you believe that most people in your industry disagree with? How does that connect to the problem that your product or service solves? At Fame, we believe that interruption is the enemy, and that hashtag # b2b marketers should shift their budget from eBooks/trade shows/outbound to audience building. It‚Äôs controversial‚Ä¶ and it educates our ideal buyers about the problem that our service solves. What is the ‚Äúspicy narrative‚Äù for your business? 3Ô∏è‚É£ Post organically For 95% of B2B businesses, your daily customers are on LinkedIn. So we need to: - Post regularly - Optimise our influencer's profile - Engage with other thought leaders in the niche The content will largely be based on the spicy narrative defined in Step 2Ô∏è‚É£ but can also cover: - Industry trends/news - Company wins/culture - Anything else relevant to the ideal customer 4Ô∏è‚É£ Transition to owned channels LinkedIn owns your followers. A mid-level product manager could propose an algorithm change that would cut your reach by 50%. Plus, we want to get more intimate with this audience if we‚Äôre going to bring them around to our way of thinking (the spicy narrative). So we make it simple, easy and compelling for them to take the next step: - Email newsletter - Podcast Either will work. Both should further explore the spicy narrative, along with guests (other people with influence in the niche). - Email is easier to grow - Podcasts form a deeper bond 5Ô∏è‚É£ Compound This is the easy one. Keep executing and iterating for 6 months: - Better content - More spicy narratives - Higher production value The flywheel will take a couple of months to start turning. But when it does, it's hard to stop. Let's summarise: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Select an internal ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù 2Ô∏è‚É£ Define a spicy narrative 3Ô∏è‚É£ Post organically 4Ô∏è‚É£ Transition to owned channels 5Ô∏è‚É£ Compound $0 spent on: - eBook creation - Trade show booths - SDR's Over to you. --- Like the plan but need help executing?

Suicide: - In-fighting - Blurry direction - Politics In Patrick Lencioni‚Äôs book The Advantage, he states that healthy businesses do four things: - Strong leadership team - Define clarity - Communicate clarity - Reinforce clarity The CEO‚Äôs job is to build a healthy organisation. 2Ô∏è‚É£ If it doesn‚Äôt grow, it dies Growing businesses bring new opportunities. Shrinking businesses kill them. If you want to hire and develop great people, you need new opportunities. The CEO‚Äôs job is to hit growth goals. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Ask how you can be a better manager As CEO, you‚Äôre managing your best managers. As CEO, you also may think that anyone else in the business should/can give you feedback. This is a dangerous trap. I‚Äôve added this question to the end of each monthly performance discussion I have with the people I manage: ‚ÄúHow can I be a better manager for you?‚Äù The CEO‚Äôs job is to be an awesome manager. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Delegate everything If you‚Äôre in the boiler room fixing the engine, you won‚Äôt see the iceberg. Yes, there may be small tasks you like or are incredible at, keep them if they take up less than 10% of your time. In other words, you need to be Teflon for tasks. The CEO‚Äôs job is to steer the ship. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Performance management is massive Your job as the CEO is to hit the numbers. But as per the point above, if you can‚Äôt do any work‚Ä¶ how do you influence said numbers? Performance management. It‚Äôs your job to ensure that you allow the right people on the bus and then keep the right people. Over time, you will let people on the bus who are right, but as the bus evolves, they will no longer be the right person. It‚Äôs up to you to ensure this happens.

"3 weeks ago I had a brutal week, ending with a 6pm Friday sales call that went surprisingly better than I could ever imagine. The week was hard: - Hiring - Creating new services - Performance conversations But it‚Äôs Friday afternoon, and it‚Äôs a sales call. Hopefully, it's a quick and easy one. It‚Äôs with a potential client whose business I‚Äôve been following for years. - Love the CEO - Love the brand It‚Äôs a second call, and since the first one, we have introduced him to two client references. I‚Äôm a little nervous. - What did they say? - Would it be good enough? We jump on the call, and I ask about the references.

"We have 71, 100% remote team members. And it works. Here are 7 reasons why: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Extreme role clarity Each person has a clearly defined role, with an abbreviation. For example, we have a role called ‚ÄúProofreader & Guest Researcher‚Äù or ‚ÄúPGR‚Äù. We have a very clear definition of what the PGR does and doesn‚Äôt do. Each PGR, has this code in their Slack profile description. Chaos compounds with business growth. This is one of the antidotes. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Regular in-person meetups Have a regular cadence of optional in-person meet-ups. Important: must be optional if you have a fully remote work policy. Doesn‚Äôt need to be frequent, but must be regular. We do annually. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Consistent team meeting cadence The whole team meets (remotely) once per week where we talk about things that aren‚Äôt work-related. Teams also meet weekly and also talk about things that aren‚Äôt work-related. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt track time Yes, we have core hours. But we don‚Äôt care if someone needs to finish early or starts late. We care about client happiness. So we don‚Äôt clock watch, but we do have a robust performance management process. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Strict, clear internal comms procedures Slack or email? Channel or DM? Everything needs to be defined, understood and documented. If not, the team will spend more time communicating than doing actual work. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Peer-to-peer learning When remote, it can be hard for team members to learn about each other. A great way to solve this is to have a regular training session, led by a different team member each time. This helps the team learn not only about what you do but also about each other. 7Ô∏è‚É£ Create a CustomGPT Upload all your documentation to create a custom GPT, that will act as the person sitting next to you in an office. Have your whole team bookmark it and ideally use that before DM‚Äôing someone on Slack. Remote may not work for you. But it could.

"In 49 months, I grew my business from $0-$3m ARR. Here are the 7 biggest mistakes I made along the way: 1Ô∏è‚É£ I accepted absolutely anyone as a customer Revenue: $500k ARR I was cash-hungry from day one. Just wanted new sales regardless of whether we could help them achieve their goals. It took over a year to start saying no to prospects that we weren‚Äôt fit for. 2Ô∏è‚É£ I didn‚Äôt go all in until $1m ARR Revenue: $1m ARR I love starting things. In the first year or so of Fame, I had: - Coaching clients - Was building a SaaS - Wrote a daily email newsletter To make something great, it needs to be a full-time focus. This took me nearly 18 months to learn. 3Ô∏è‚É£ I used to sell myself Revenue: $1.5 ARR I would tell clients that I would personally work with them to get them over the line. This was fine for 1 or 2. But when it became 4-5, and I had a whole business to run‚Ä¶ I had to step back, which led to churn. 4Ô∏è‚É£ I nurtured badly behaved clients Revenue: $2m ARR I was a slave to the monthly revenue chart. If firing a bad client meant that we wouldn‚Äôt beat this month's number‚Ä¶ we would keep them. This caused pain for the team and didn‚Äôt help revenue as they would eventually leave. Zoom out past this month‚Äôs revenue. 5Ô∏è‚É£ I made every big decision myself Revenue: $2.5 ARR My ego wanted me to be the boss. ‚ÄúNo one else is going to build this business for me‚Äù. I was wrong. We would have moved faster if I had worked with a coach sooner (e.g. someone who has done this before). Shout out to Gellan and Alan . 6Ô∏è‚É£ I took too long to produce clear role outcomes Revenue: $2.5m ARR As we scaled, team members would join, and we would have no idea if they were performing or not. We have clear expectations of performance. This hurt us (kept the wrong people on longer) and our team members (they didn‚Äôt have a clear roadmap). Having this in place would have doubled our new hire success rate. 7Ô∏è‚É£ It took me 4 years to become a CEO Revenue: $3m ARR I finally became CEO this month. 4 years since we started the business. I didn‚Äôt trust others to do everything we needed to do to run and grow the business. Now there is a leadership team, and I‚Äôm finally CEO. But if we had this a year ago, we would likely be a better business today. Growing anything is hard. I hope I don‚Äôt make these mistakes again. What I do know is that I‚Äôll continue to make mistakes... Just new ones.

"It took 3 years for Confessions of a B2B Entrepreneur to generate leads. Here‚Äôs how you can do it in 3 months: 1. Focus This process only works if your podcast is better than other shows in the niche. An easy way to achieve this is to go narrow. This reduces the number and quality of competing shows. Choose the niche, and stick to it for the 3 months. For Confessions of a B2B Marketer this is ‚Äúb2b marketing‚Äù. 2. Define your Edge Focus is not enough. You also need an Edge. E.g. what a listener would tell their friends about your show. For Confessions of a B2B Marketer, this is the ‚Äúconfessions‚Äù part. 3. Launch As we only have 3 months, we aren‚Äôt going to promote too much to new audiences. We are going to launch to your existing audience. Prep 2-3 episodes, get them live on Apple/Spotify. Then get the following to follow, rate and review the show within 48 hours of launch: - Friends/family - Employees - Social followers - Email subscribers - Partners (reach out before and ask them to promote) If done right, we will spike up the charts in Apple Podcasts, which will ultimately attract more listeners. 4. Perfect the system To build the audience needed to generate inbound leads, you need to build a system and have it operated by someone else. We can‚Äôt have a ‚Äúlack of time‚Äù disrupt our posting schedule. 5. Insert a non-intrusive CTA It took me 2.5 years to insert ads for Fame in Confessions of a B2B Marketer. Don‚Äôt wait that long You must read the ads, and they must be highly relevant, non-intrusive and have character. Make the CTA clear e.g. ‚Äúhead over to ‚Äúfame dot so‚Äù and request a proposal, we will be in touch within 24 hours‚Äù 6. Iterate & improve Retention is the foundation of growth. Before going hard on promotion (that‚Äôs the topic of another post), we need to fill the holes in the bucket.

"How I grow Confessions of a B2B Entrepreneur each week. With $0 ad spend. HINT - it includes LinkedIn. And takes just 30 minutes per episode. How? A single post from my profile for each episode. Simple, but extremely effective if executed correctly. Here are the 6 steps: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Nail the hook This is often a small comment or concept from the episode that is: - Crazy - Unusual - Controversial Pull this out, and write it in a way that will stop the scroll. I will link to a few posts with example hooks in the comments below üëá 2Ô∏è‚É£ Build the slippery slope Once a reader is hooked, you need to keep their attention. You need to keep their attention until they reach the first comment, where you will then link out to the episode. This takes practice but here are some tips: - Study and write out great sales pages - Vary sentence length - No more than one sentence per line 3Ô∏è‚É£ Tag the guest But only if you are confident you engage. If you tag them, and they engage, you will get more impressions. If you tag them, and they don‚Äôt, you will get fewer impressions. I typically always tag, and then copy the link of the post and send it to the guest via DM. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Tag the show Create a ‚ÄúCompany Page‚Äù for your show. Tag it in every post and over time you will find that guests and listeners will start to tag this page too. Make it easy. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Add an image LinkedIn loves images. So you will get more impressions. It‚Äôs also an opportunity to capture some of the authority of your guest and transfer it over to yourself/your host. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Iterate This is key. What works for Confessions of a B2B Entrepreneur , may not work for you. So you need to test and tweak: - Hook styles - Image type - Length of post It could take time, but it will be worth it.

"Confessions of a B2B Marketer drives Fame‚Äôs growth. How? Here are 7 ways: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Personal LinkedIn Content It baffles me. My best-performing organic posts drive people to listen to that week‚Äôs podcast episode. Crazy right? You would expect the algorithm to deprioritise those. For some reason, it doesn‚Äôt, and my personal profile gains thousands of followers each week. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Outbound Cadences When running outbound, you need to build authority fast. If you don‚Äôt, you get ignored, or worse: put into spam. One way to do this is to link out to episodes of your podcasts from the ‚ÄúP.S.‚Äù of your outbound cadence. If this episode includes a big-name guest your prospect will know‚Ä¶ Instant authority. 3Ô∏è‚É£ LinkedIn Impressions Each episode is cut up into 4-5 snippets that are then posted daily from the Confessions of a B2B Entrepreneur LinkedIn Page. Each post raises awareness for the episode, driving new followers‚Ä¶ but also gives the guest another chance to share/engage, driving more free exposure from the algorithm. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Strategy Having high-level discussions on B2B with the brightest minds in the industry changes the way you think. - Chris Walker - Devin Reed - Travis Tyler - Nick Bennett - Arthur Castillo - Obaid Durani All of these have been studying hashtag # b2b for years, and I get to ask them anything I want (within reason!).

"Confessions of a B2B Marketer just hit 1,000 followers on Spotify. It took 2 years to get to 378, we just added 622 in 12 months. (Without paid promotion) How? üëá 1. Bring on guests you love The audience will know if you (the host) are not excited by the content of the episode. This can‚Äôt be faked. Bring on guests that you want to speak to anyway. Enable them to shine. 2. Iterate on a format When you start, you have no idea what will resonate with your audience. Test things, tweak them, improve them and then review statistics to do more of what works. We have landed on an actionable interview show 3 times per month, with a solo recorded growth breakdown of a B2B business once per month. Right now, it seems to be working. 3. Track consumption Now we have guests that you love, and we are starting to test formats and styles, be sure to track episode downloads and consumption. Keep iterating until you see episode consumption start to trend up. Until that, don‚Äôt go hard promotion. 4. Nail an organic social strategy Choose one social platform, and iterate until you‚Äôre getting free attention. In our case, it‚Äôs LinkedIn from both my personal and the Company Page of the podcast ( Confessions of a B2B Entrepreneur ). 5. Understand Audio SEO Be found in Apple Podcasts & Spotify for your primary keywords. It‚Äôs easier than you think. 6. Implement Audio Ads & SRA Not directly tied to growth, but every deal closed that can be attributed to the podcast should unlock new budget to invest in production. This will grow the audience further, leading to more deals attributed, and the cycle continues. Make sure you have self-reported attribution on your core CTA and you include audio ads for your core CTA once the show is growing. 7. Run outbound to target accounts More on this later, but we‚Äôve been IP-matching people that download the show, to then run targeted outbound to our customer personas at those businesses.

"Our growth team closes 5 figures of MRR each month. It consists of 3 full-time team members. Here‚Äôs the 7-step process we use to run the team: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Growth Programs Anything the growth team does, must be assigned to a Growth Program e.g. ‚ÄúTH LinkedIn Organic‚Äù is the Growth Program for my organic LinkedIn posting. Any new ideas from anyone in the growth team or business must be added as a Growth Program on a Trello Board. Growth Programs move through the following stages as they mature: Phase 0 - Ideas Phase 1 - Experiments Phase 2 - Positive Signals Phase 3 - Repeatability Phase 4 - Operationalize & Scale Phase 5 - Fully Integrated 2Ô∏è‚É£ Growth Tasks As mentioned above, anything the growth team does must be assigned to a Growth Program. We have another Trello Board called ‚ÄúGrowth Tasks‚Äù, each task is labelled with the Growth Program it is attached to. All tasks must be assigned to a Growth Program and are assigned, reviewed and signed off in Trello. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Crystal Clear Roles Each role in the Growth Team is documented so there is no confusion about who is responsible for what: HOG - Head of Growth, responsible for OKRs ISP - Inbound Salesperson, responsible for managing the inbound pipeline GA - Growth Assistant, responsible for supporting Growth Programs D - Designer, responsible for visual design W - Writer, responsible for writing content VE - Video Editor, responsible for editing video AE - Audio Editor, responsible for editing audio 4Ô∏è‚É£ Document Everything Any task that will need to be done multiple times, must be documented. You will thank me later. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Weekly Meetings Get a Google Doc, and split it into two sections: Agenda & Actions. Each week, use this Google Doc to answer questions, share wisdom and track actions. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Quarterly OKRs Each quarter, the growth team (along with the rest of the business) defines 3 objectives with approx. 6-8 key results to focus on. Progress towards each OKR is tracked in the weekly meetings. 7Ô∏è‚É£ Objective Thinking Just because a Growth Program makes you feel good or generates likes on LinkedIn, does not mean that further investments should be made. We track the amount invested in each Growth Program and compare that to software and self-reported attribution to judge whether further investment should be made.

But how do you get their attention (without paying). I‚Äôve been tweaking this strategy for the past 6 months. It's now starting to pay dividends üëá 1Ô∏è‚É£ Amazing guest experience Make sure your guests have a smooth booking and awesome interview experience. If they don‚Äôt, your share rate (% of guests that share their episode) will plummet. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Select the hook Pick out the one controversial, unusual, outrageous thing from the episode and open your post with it. For example, I interviewed Tim Soulo of Ahrefs on the pod, we covered 9 different strategies. But I opened the post with the fact that they don‚Äôt use Google Analytics or the Facebook Pixel. That is a hook. 3Ô∏è‚É£ The slippery slope Once the hook is defined, you need to take your readers on a slippery slope all the way down to the CTA to check out the episode. Add insights from the episode or not, it doesn‚Äôt really matter. What matters is that you keep the reader reading. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Add the `authority shot` Take a screenshot from the video recording of both you and the guest looking happy and add it to the post. This reminds your audience that you are connected to high value people in your niche, transferring some of their authority onto you. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Tag & remind Tag your guest and the guests business, then DM your guest on LinkedIn as soon as your post goes live. If they had a great experience on your show, they will like, comment and maybe even repost.

"How we 10x‚Äôd LinkedIn traffic whilst spending basically $0 üëá Let‚Äôs face it. If you‚Äôre in hashtag # b2b , your ideal customers are on LinkedIn. Here are 7 ways we‚Äôve blown up LinkedIn referral traffic in 18 months, with minimal ad budget: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Zero Click Content from Company Page I‚Äôm not talking ‚Äúcompany updates‚Äù‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm talking content that would resonate/inform/entertain your ideal buyer. Keep iterating until you see engagement. We started off posting images asking controversial questions about our industry... now we only post text. 2Ô∏è‚É£ More Company Pages Your podcast needs a page. Your new video series needs a page. Every content franchise needs a page. This allows that media assets to tag people, comment and of course‚Ä¶ be tagged. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sidebar Text Ads Set up sidebar text ads with a CTA to your homepage. These are charged per click but receive few clicks. We‚Äôve run these for 4 months and received 296,144 impressions for $54.12. $0.18 CPM. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Boost Customer Wins When something great happens with a customer, post about it on the Company Page, tag your clients and their business and then boost the post with $50-100. The customer will likely comment and share. Making you look amazing to their connections. This makes your customer happy and reminds them that you exist on LinkedIn, increasing the likelihood of future engagement. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Get your CEO posting regularly There is a lot written about this... I will say that the benefits don‚Äôt stop at raising awareness with prospects, but also help with internal employee engagement, partnerships and hiring. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Test boosting CEO‚Äôs posts via Page Once the CEO is getting some traction with these posts, start boosting them to warm audiences with the new LinkedIn Employee Post Ads. 7Ô∏è‚É£ Custom audiences from lead lists and website traffic If you‚Äôre running cold outbound and you have any website traffic, create custom audiences on LinkedIn to promote the Company Page/CEO content that has the most organic engagement.

"We had been working with Spartak since 2016. He was editing the first podcast I ever released, and he delivered note-perfect audio each time, with a smile. That podcast died and I moved onto a new role, started another podcast, and brought Spartak along. Again, perfect audio, delivered on time, every time. But then one day, replies started slowing down‚Ä¶ and the audio quality dropped a little. A few months later, everything was back to normal and the podcast was starting to perform. Then I get a message on Slack: `Tom, this is Olha, Spartak's wife Spartak died a week ago.` Here's what happened: Spartak and Olha were living together happily. They were working together using Spartak‚Äôs accounts. Olha communicated with clients, and Spartak edited audio. But Spartak was also teaching Olha how to edit. And then Olha started to take on some of Spartak's work, behind the scenes, from Spartak's Slack/Trello accounts. Which is completely understandable. She asked if she could continue working with us. `Of course,` we said. That was back in 2020 Since then, she has edited hundreds, if not thousands of podcast episodes for us. Originally Ukrainian, Olha has now found a new home in Turkey. And the quality of her work and collaboration only continue to level up, helping us scale from 0 to 75 clients.

"Your customer is on a journey. The success of your business (and hashtag # b2b marketing function) will be defined by your ability to help your customers on this journey. There are two ways you can do this: 1Ô∏è‚É£ With your product or service 2Ô∏è‚É£ With information We will leave the first one to the engineering and operations experts ü§ì The second one? This sits with us. This sits with marketing. To build the trust of our customers we must add value first, without a thought of our own goals. We must map out the journey that our ideal customer is going on, list out the core challenges they are facing and then help customers navigate these with information. Now ideally, you have the expertise in-house to create the information that will help your ideal customer break these barriers, if not, you need to find someone who does and pay them. (Don't worry, the budget can be moved from your current, wasted `interruption` spend ;)) So first you create the content, then you get some eyeballs on it and look for qualitative feedback that this content is making a difference. This could be: üëâ A meaningful Linkedin comment üëâ A reply to an email üëâ A backlink from a respected influencer Once these things start to happen, we can move to Step 2. Now Step 2 is really simple... We take all the ad spend that was going to interrupt people, driving them to CTA's and invest it into getting more of our ideal customers to consume this transformational content. Things will start slow, but with every transformation, you help facilitate, brand affinity and word of mouth will grow. And in a year or two, your acquisition costs will start to drop and rapid growth will follow. Going back to the start of this post, those marketing teams that facilitate the journey of the ideal customer, instead of interrupting them... will win in the long term. These marketers will build brands that people love. A brand whose customer acquisition costs will trend down over time as word of mouth spreads. So this is my challenge to you: üëâ Can you hire or work with a true expert in your niche to create content that will help your customers transform regardless of whether they pay you? üëâ Can you divert all your paid spend away from `interrupting CTAs` directing to a CTA and towards non-gated content that will transform?",2y,20,5,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhuntio?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXth68BPjXrbCWKVEpQg1k0lVDiHAyD_ek

"Darkness. This is where most B2B marketers exist. Swimming in a sea of data darkness, no idea how someone found you, what made them click or why they converted.

"Fame‚Äôs team has grown from 8 to 36 in the past twelve months, fully remote‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs 5 things I've learnt about hashtag # management : 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Peter Principle Most people are promoted to a level of incompetence.

This can leave a large skill gap in any business with more than 10 employees: management. 2Ô∏è‚É£ A manager‚Äôs output Their own output + output of their team = total output Therefore good managers leverage their output by influencing the performance of their managees. 3Ô∏è‚É£ 6 types of managerial activities: üëâ Information gathering - crucial for making effective decisions üëâ Information conveying - crucial for developing managees üëâ Monitoring - don‚Äôt abdicate üëâ Decision-making - use where necessary üëâ Nudging - great for developing managees üëâ Meddling - only use if absolutely necessary 4Ô∏è‚É£ Meetings get a bad rep I used to think meetings were a waste of time.

(100% bootstrapped and remote) Here are 5 things I learnt: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Teflon for tasks üëâ Paying invoices üëâ Sourcing candidates üëâ Running the sales process Are all things that I‚Äôve done since day one. But not anymore. Andrew Wilkinson once said on a podcast interview that his secret to success was that he‚Äôs lazy, he‚Äôs like teflon for tasks, they slip off him. My end-of-year goal is to be completely removed from day-to-day operations. Doing so, frees you up to focus on higher leverage tasks: process innovation and talent development. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Managee‚Äôs become managers Employee churn is a silent killer. You lose morale, client relationships and process knowledge with each lost employee. As you grow, you can't do all the management. In other words: your managee‚Äôs, need to become managers. And you need to train them. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve found to be the managerial secret: understand what the employees want, and then give it to them. E.g. if a new team member wants to be flexible with their family commitment, allow this (along as their work is getting done) In short make the deal so good, they can‚Äôt leave. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Capture vs create demand Yes I hear you demand gen clones: creating demand is a thing. Capturing demand can get you to ¬£1m ARR, but ¬£10m? Maybe not. It‚Äôs time to start creating demand. How? Create and distribute content that educates ideal customers about the problems that your product/services solves. Simple‚Ä¶ but making the content good enough so that your ideal customers actually want to consume it? Not easy. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Non-essential costs We still don‚Äôt pay for Slack, Trello or Freshdesk. Why? Because doing so would mean that in some way, that cost would need to be passed on to our wonderful clients. And passing on the cost to a client, to pay for something that we don‚Äôt think directly increases their happiness, doesn‚Äôt sit right with us. After all, our primary value is: Client Client Client. Choices like this enable us to increase the ‚Äúconsumer surplus‚Äù or the ‚Äúbrand‚Äù value of our service: the difference between what a client pays, and what they get. This ‚Äúgoodwill‚Äù seems to find its way back to us in the form of inbound demand that we cannot attribute. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt fuck up the momentum Peter Thiel famous told the Airbnb founders to not fuck up the culture. But what I think he really meant was: don‚Äôt fuck up the momentum. Past product market fit, a business starts the transition from the jet ski to a cruise ship. Ops, finance and hiring become more important. You, as a founder need to ensure the business keeps going in the same direction, and you need to make this crystal clear to your team and your clients. You also need to keep growing at all costs, which may mean reducing profitability in the short term. Changing direction, or a slow down in growth, confuses and demoralises. Which could lead to the dreaded employee churn. Hope that helps ü§ì",2y,128,53,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhuntio?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXth68BPjXrbCWKVEpQg1k0lVDiHAyD_ek

"Your hashtag # b2b buyer is on a journey. The success of your biz (and marketing function) will be defined by your ability to help your customers on this journey. There are two ways to do this: 1Ô∏è‚É£ With your software or service 2Ô∏è‚É£ With information We will leave the first one to the engineering/product/ops. The second one? This sits with us. This sits with marketing. We must map out the journey that our ideal customer is going on, list out the core challenges they are facing, and help customers navigate these... with information. Ideally, you have the expertise in-house to create the information that will help your ideal customer break these barriers, if not, you need to find someone who does and pay them. (Don't worry, the budget can be moved from your current, wasted paid spend ;)) So first you create the content, promote and look for qualitative feedback that this content is making a difference. This could be: üëâ A meaningful Linkedin comment üëâ A reply to an email üëâ A backlink from a respected, niche publication Once these things start to happen, we can move to Step 2. Now Step 2 is really simple... We take all the ad spend that was going to interrupt people and invest it into getting more of our ideal buyers to consume this transformational content. Things will start slow, but with every transformation, you help facilitate, brand affinity and word of mouth will grow. Marketing teams that facilitate the journey of the ideal customer, instead of interrupting them... will win in the long term. These marketers will build brands that people love. A brand whose customer acquisition costs will trend down over time as word of mouth spreads. So this is my challenge to you: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Can you hire or work with a true expert in your niche to create content that will help your customers transform regardless of whether they pay you? 2Ô∏è‚É£ Can you divert all your paid spend away from `interrupting CTAs` directing to a CTA and towards non-gated content that will transform?",2y,14,3,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhuntio?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXth68BPjXrbCWKVEpQg1k0lVDiHAyD_ek

"0-$1m ARR in 2.5 years, bootstrapped. Here are 7 learnings üëá 1Ô∏è‚É£ The role of the founder Your business is just a collection of deals. You have deals with suppliers, freelancers, employees and of course: customers. Your role is simply to ensure that every one of these groups of people is getting a good deal. Take employees for example‚Ä¶ üëâ No one has ever been asked to work late üëâ We have private healthcare üëâ We are 100% remote üëâ We have minimal meetings üëâ All team members and freelancers receive a monthly, performance-based bonus The result? No employees have left in 2.5 years. It seems like the deal is good. 2Ô∏è‚É£ You will f*ck up We have f*cked up on multiple clients. These even ended up in legal proceedings. When you do enough volume, it will happen. You just need to learn how to improve so they happen less often. 3Ô∏è‚É£ The tennis court Once your initial demand problem is solved‚Ä¶ you will then develop a delivery problem. Especially if you are a people business. You need to watch the scene from The Founder, where the McDonalds brothers are orchestrating their food delivery system on a tennis court dived up with chalk lines (link in comments üëá). This is the focus and obsession you need to build to solve your delivery problem. 4Ô∏è‚É£ On getting customers As soon as you get your first one‚Ä¶ do everything you can to make them happy. Yep, even lose money. Don‚Äôt get greedy. You don‚Äôt deserve customers if you can‚Äôt make them happy. 5Ô∏è‚É£ On getting more customers Start with JUST two channels: üëâ Word of mouth and referrals driven by your work on Step 4Ô∏è‚É£ above üëâ One other that you as the founder are responsible for getting to work Then ONLY once both of these are working, you move on to the next channel, stacking them on top of each other over time. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Ruthlessly strip unnecessary costs Once you have something that is making customers happy: ruthlessly strip costs from anything that isn‚Äôt directly tied to what is making customers happy. Jeff Bezos gets this: Amazon is better AND cheaper. If you can be better AND cheaper than your competitors, you will grow much faster. We don‚Äôt pay for Slack, Trello, trade shows or anything else that doesn't directly increase client happiness. 7Ô∏è‚É£ Firing people can be kind It‚Äôs cute to believe in people that are struggling, keeping them on too long‚Ä¶ but ultimately it isn‚Äôt good for them, you or the business. The faster you break up and help them find a new and better-suited role, the better off everyone will be.

This way, each episode should pull in a long tail of downloads: this will snowball over time. üï∏ Content Syndication - Pulling out best bits and posting to social for engagement and driving traffic back to the full episode. Key here is to pull out the most valuable, outrageous, funny or weird clips. üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Guest Sharing - Maximising the % of guests that share by making it as easy as possible to share/incentivising them to share.

E.g. the best type of podcast hosting customers ;) Not the `hobbyists`, not the `creators`, the businesses that want to use a podcast to grow... and are more likely to make an ROI on the show, and therefore keep paying us.

Ours is: `Podcast Hosting For High Growth Businesses`. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Content/Social/SEO Flywheel From day one, you are pushing your Content/Social/SEO Flywheel... the real question is... how fast?

Our organic clicks have gone from 2-3 per day to 300 per day in 12 months. We create SEO optimised content, host it on the blog, share on social channels, promote in other places and then REPEAT. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding acquisition channels bCast costs between $15 and $75 per month. This means we can't: üëâ Have sales people üëâ Run paid traffic üëâ Advertise on podcasts We have to invest in acquisition channels that will bring us customers for less than $100... and neither of those will ;) We focus on just three channels and expect to keep doing so for many months: üëâ User Led Growth üëâ Content/Social/SEO Flywheel (see #2 above) üëâ Affiliates (We have the most generous affiliate program in podcasting) This is super important... acquisition channels take months to build up, make sure you start building up the channels that will work for your price point from day one. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Speaking to every new free trial Each new free trial gets this email that I send MANUALLY, link in comments below for template...

This helps massively with our product roadmap :) 5Ô∏è‚É£ Relentless focus on speed We know that we are on a timeline... We know we need to build stuff that other podcast hosts either can't or won't build and FAST. So we eradicate everything from our internal processes that will get in the way of us doing this fast. For example... we very rarely have internal meetings, we automate as much of customer support as we can and ensure internal processes are documented to reduce Slack comms.

"The law of reciprocity: `When you do something for someone else, they are more likely to want to do something for you` ‚Ä¶is a human psychological bias originating from times when we existed within a tribe and exodus from this tribe meant almost certain death.

Step 2: Find Strategic Guests üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The next step is to be more strategic about who you‚Äôre bringing on your podcast as guests. üëâ Maybe they are an ideal customer üëâ Maybe they run a massive blog in your niche, and you would love a backlink üëâ Maybe they have a big audience of your ideal customers on their YouTube channel Short term podcast profitability comes from strategic guest relationships, not audience growth. Step 3: Listeners To LeadsüëÇ We now need to create a value ladder for your listeners: to turn them from listeners into leads.

Step 4 ‚Äì Operate & Improve üìà You need to track everything in Trello or a spreadsheet, define very clear writing guidelines (a copy of ours is the comments) and then stick to the process.

"Define: hashtag # marketer I think there are three levels: üëâ Level 1 - Can execute tactics üëâ Level 2 - Can combine tactics into a cohesive strategy that gets results üëâ Level 3 - Can understand AND feedback from the customer to improve product A Level 3 marketer can execute tactics, combine these to form a cohesive strategy, but they can also `close the loop`. They truly understand the customer and use this knowledge to build a strategy that meets them where they are‚Ä¶ and brings them to where they are trying to get to. But then they take this a step further‚Ä¶ they actively fight for the customer during internal product and strategy sessions. When done correctly, it won't be long until they sculpt the product into something irresistible to the customer and rapid growth soon follows... making the marketer look good. If you agree, tag a Level 3 marketer in the comments below... ü§ì",4y,27,5,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhuntio?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXth68BPjXrbCWKVEpQg1k0lVDiHAyD_ek
"The story starts approximately 18 months ago... It's a Saturday in May. üîÜ And for some reason, I'm not having fun with my friends... I am writing up the next case study for the SaaS Marketer community. It's on a hashtag # SaaS business called Riddle.com . So of course... I need to check this out. I head to their site, ping open the live chat to ask some stupid test question and BOOM. Boris (their founder replies). WTF. I actually end up chatting to both hashtag # founders through their live chat. Mike was slightly delayed as he was at a BBQ. This is super interesting - why are these guys on hashtag # customersupport ? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è So I had to bring Mike Hawkins onto the Confessions Of A hashtag # B2BMarketer hashtag # podcast to understand more... üëâ Who does customer support at Riddle? üëâ Why can I reach the founders on chat on a Saturday? üëâ What impact is this `support obsession` having on their business?

"Whenever I try to break down growth of a hashtag # SaaS , I'm always looking at how they empower users to sneeze üëÉ üëâ It's you sending the Calendly link to a prospect üëâ It's you sending the Loom video to your team üëâ It's you sending the Slack invite to a new freelancer This is sneezing - also known as User Led Growth. Anyway, I spent twelve months fantasizing about `sneezing`, and only now do I have the opportunity to implement these learnings. Let's look at how bCast enables sneezing: 1 - bCast Player Our users need something to play their audio from‚Ä¶ the player is embedded into the websites of our users 2 - bCast Website We auto-generate a bCast website for all users, this gives a super easy URL for users to share to send people to their podcast 3 - Guest Emails We enable users to automatically send an email with social share links to guests of a podcast episode when published exposing the guest to the bCast brand 4 - Adding Users Another feature requested by users‚Ä¶ like Slack we will soon allow bCaster's to invite an unlimited amount of users to their account 5 - Sub/Master Accounts We enable our power users to create sub-accounts for people there are managing podcasts for and assign podcasts into those accounts.

"It's 6:00am, 27th of April 2019 and I'm sitting down to write my first SaaS growth case study. We have a grand total of 7 people on the email list. I feel intense excitement as the caffeine rushes through my veins. My girlfriend and dog are sleeping as the sun rises over East London... I am having an incredible time detailing how ConvertKit used partner webinars to grow. Over the next three months I did the same thing each weekday morning - woke up early, wrote and hit send. Today we have the largest community of SaaS Marketers in the world: 4,7k on email and 2,3k on Facebook. Though perhaps the most impactful event of the last 15 months was a single P.S. added to one of those emails. At the time I was enjoying great success with a B2B podcast we were running for a hashtag # SaaS business... and the podcast host we were using wasn't serving me as a marketer. The P.S. said something like: Anyone have experience in building web apps and a passion for hashtag # podcasting ? If yes, please reply :) Neil Morgan responds. Within a few weeks we have a basic spec for a new podcast host. We build for three months before bringing on our first customers ( Dylan , Derry , and Stewart !).

"It was a dark and wet walk home from the corporate office in London.

"Marketing exists to boost the perceived value of a product or service. It‚Äôs actual value impacts marketing through word of mouth, whether positive or negative. When your product/service has a high barrier to entry and therefore low competition, it is not necessary to inflate perceived value. And this is the reason why I believe there is a difference between Startup Marketers and Online Marketers. Online Marketers typically sell products and services where the barrier to entry is low. E.g. you can create an agency or information product simply by creating a website and sending a few emails. This proliferation of competition forces the Online Marketer to get VERY good at boosting perceived value. I personally started off in the online marketing world and I am immensely grateful for this `altitude training`. It then becomes clear that there is a massive opportunity for Startup Marketers to train in the world of the online marketer: - Metric tracking and optimisation - Sales funnels - Influence on cognitive biases Then to return to the world of great products with large barriers to entry‚Ä¶ and dominate.

"True North. A concept introduce by Steven Pressfield in his book: The War Of Art.

Has there been a time where you have persisted regardless and it paid off?",8y,9,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhuntio?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXth68BPjXrbCWKVEpQg1k0lVDiHAyD_ek
"‚ÄúThe key to more success is coco butter‚Äù From sleeping in his car parked in the rough Miami streets to doing 360's on a Jet Ski and being managed by Jay Z‚Ä¶ Dj Khaled has followed a tried and tested online marketing formula: 1. Create content 2. Promote content 3. Monetise content This post codifies Khaled's astronomical rise to fame over the past 20 years, so that we can learn how to create content like Khaled and realise a similar level of success...with or without coco butter.",8y,17,5,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomhuntio?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAXth68BPjXrbCWKVEpQg1k0lVDiHAyD_ek
"I just read The Key‚Äôs by Dj Khaled. He is a gangster. From nothing, to now literally running the global hip hop scene. The one part of the book that REALLY got me‚Ä¶ was about pillows. Yep, Khaled spent a good few paragraphs talking about pillows. The main point was that ‚Äúthey‚Äù (Khaled‚Äôs word for the haters), don‚Äôt want you to have loads of pillows‚Ä¶ so, in just the same way that ‚Äúthey‚Äù don‚Äôt want you to do 360‚Äôs on your Jet Ski or buy a Bentley‚Ä¶ You should do it. Khaled did not use to have many pillows, he actually used to have to sleep on his records in a tiny apartment when he was ‚Äúcoming up‚Äù in Miami. But now, he sleeps with a lot of pillows. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre a self made mogul, the temptation to work all the time no matter how tired you feel is high‚Äù I think Khaled is telling us to have balance, and that our best work is done when we have had adequate rest.

"Imagine waking up, logging into Google Analytics to a boatload of traffic with leads filling up your pipeline? And all this without a LARGE ad budget or relying on the dodgy backlinks you bought from Fiverr? As let's face it... - Google is too good (You can't cheat the algorithm) - Facebook is too expensive (For cold traffic and every business and their dog now use their ad platform) - Businesses still think they can churn out ‚Äúme too‚Äù content and get traffic Which is why London Startup Marketing ( Giorgia Sterza ) has brought together two pioneers ( Richard Edwards & myself) in the Content and SEO space to teach you how to be `the Flower, not the Bee`.
