"At this rate my onboarding should take about‚Ä¶ three years? According to the Cox Business 2025 Workplace Technology Survey, two-thirds of Gen Z and Millennials feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of tools they‚Äôre expected to use at work.¬†The other third are apparently lying (jk). I remember onboarding at my first 'big girl' job for my 2018 summer internship - back when learning three new platforms felt like a lot. Seven years later, it‚Äôs only gotten worse. To any IT and business leaders reading this: it's time to take a more strategic and thoughtful approach to workplace tech roll-outs. Revolutionary idea, I know - choosing tools based on actual need rather than whatever had the shiniest demo at the latest conference. Cox Business surveyed younger professionals to understand how workplace tech is really impacting productivity - and burnout. The takeaway? Simpler, more intentional tech stacks lead to smoother onboarding and better outcomes across the board. Cox Business is now helping organizations align tech with business objectives.

"It‚Äôs 2025, and I still hear about companies - sometimes quietly, sometimes blatantly - not hiring women. And every time, it stings. Not because I‚Äôm surprised. But because it‚Äôs still happening. It‚Äôs disheartening to know that qualified, capable women are overlooked. It‚Äôs frustrating to see bias win over merit. It‚Äôs discouraging that outdated assumptions still shape hiring decisions. I got engaged recently (yay!), and multiple people - well-meaning, I‚Äôm sure - have told me to ‚Äúhide my ring‚Äù in interviews and important meetings. Just in case someone assumes I‚Äôll be less committed, more distracted, or planning to disappear soon. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre still up against. Hiring women isn‚Äôt a favor. It‚Äôs not a risk. It‚Äôs not a liability. It‚Äôs an investment in strength, perspective, and capability. If your workplace sees that as a threat - you‚Äôre the problem, not us.

"My fianc√© just graduated from Stanford Business School, and naturally my first thought was: What's in it for me? I read through his courses for his last quarter, and decided to crash his class called ‚ÄúWinning Writing.‚Äù Taught by Glenn Kramon , the class offers ‚Äútechniques and practical exercises for writing better -- better memos, emails, and feedback for colleagues.‚Äù As someone who writes countless emails, gives constant feedback, and pitches ideas daily, I knew this could be game-changing. Since we can't all crash Stanford classes, here are the three techniques that will transform how you write starting today: Kill your adverbs: We know that you're ‚Äúcurrently‚Äù writing this email, because, well, it is the current time. We know that it‚Äôs unfortunate that the budget was cut, but we don‚Äôt need you to tell us it‚Äôs ‚Äúunfortunately been cut.‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre ‚Äúreally‚Äù excited about the new initiative. Being `excited` is enough. Next time you type out ‚Äúwe can absolutely do that,‚Äù try deleting the ‚Äúabsolutely.‚Äù Rethink how you give feedback: The framework for this is to say what you like (praise) and then what you would like (suggestions for improvement), not what you don't like. I'll use myself as an example (yes, I'm sometimes late to meetings - this is vulnerable, okay): ‚Ä¢ DON‚ÄôT DO THIS: ‚ÄúNatalie, you're often late to meetings. It‚Äôs unprofessional, and doesn‚Äôt bode well with clients.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Instead, TRY THIS: ‚ÄúNatalie. You sparkle in meetings and clients love you -- when you're on time. Would you show up a couple minutes before the meeting starts to assure you‚Äôre ready and all your tech is working.‚Äù Lead with your headline: A powerful message has a Headline (10%), Example (80%), and Relevance (10%). If you‚Äôre speaking, on a micro-scale in meetings, or on stage giving a keynote, try to open with a clear statement. I tend to bury the point of what I‚Äôm saying beneath a pile of ‚Äúums,‚Äù ‚Äúlikes,‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is probably stupid but‚Ä¶‚Äù Say your main thought straight out of the gate! Your turn: Pick one technique and use it this week. Then tell me which one made the biggest difference.

People often ask how I stay connected to corporate life as a full-time content creator. Easy. I stay curious, and I stay close to conversations like these ‚Äî whether on stage, in meetings, or in my DMs with all of you. I get a front-row seat to the realities teams are facing across industries, and I‚Äôm constantly learning. This panel was HR-focused, and while I‚Äôm not an HR expert, I‚Äôve spent five years making fun of the constant surveys, recruitment nightmares, and super sexy compliance training modules. Through my videos, I get to represent the voices of employees who share their workplace wins, woes, and wellness survey fatigue with me every day. And that matters. So thank you - for trusting me with your stories, for laughing at my (occasional) jokes, and for letting me show up as a voice for the modern workforce.

"My hottest take? Leadership needs to show they‚Äôre human - just like these folks who bravely grabbed the mini mic with me this past week at Fortune 's Workplace Innovation Summit. As an early-in-career individual, I used to FEAR the execs at my companies. The interns and new hires would exchange hushed whispers if a partner walked by the main space of the office. Does it really have to be that way? To leadership folks reading this: you don‚Äôt have to post on socials and become an ‚Äúexecutive influencer‚Äù (although that‚Äôs something I LOVE, but I‚Äôll save that for another post). You can start by simply making yourself known online. Did the CEO of Indeed need to carve out ten minutes for this interview at a conference he was sponsoring? Definitely not. But he did. And now you all get to hear us talk candidly about real-world workplace anxieties around AI. Execs: Leave the buttoned-up All Hands approach at the door, and start making your presence known online!

Your readers (and their attention spans) will thank you. ‚ôªÔ∏è Repurpose + Repackage No one remembers the last video they watched‚Äîyour followers included. Reuse content across platforms, but tailor the caption for LinkedIn. Give it a smart, business-y twist and it‚Äôll land. üì• DMs > Impressions Metrics matter, but the best signal of real engagement? Inbound messages. If your content sparks DMs, you‚Äôre onto something. üìä Pick 3 Content Pillars Rotate and test: maybe it‚Äôs humor, insights, and hot takes. Give it 3 months and track what sticks. üß† Be a User First Scroll. Like. Comment. The only way to speak LinkedIn fluently is to immerse yourself in it. Yes, even in the sea of cringe.

"I‚Äôm 100% a better speaker than I was last year. I‚Äôm also 100% a worse speaker than I will be next year. Public speaking doesn't have to be your superpower, but here are 3 steps to hack public speaking as a non-pro speaker (cue 23-year old Natalie getting on a stage with nothing to say but a whole lot of confidence - I wish someone had told me these three things): Step 1: Know Your Audience ‚Ü≥ I always ask for the audience demographic details from event organizers. ‚Ü≥ Doing this helps you nail down examples and references that hit home. üí°¬†Learning from experience: I once geared my content towards Gen Z, only to find it was a millennial crowd. Oops! Step 2. Hire a Coach ‚Ü≥ A speaking coach is what took my delivery to the pro level. If a tennis pro was struggling with their backhand, they‚Äôd get a coach immediately - why can‚Äôt we do the same for our professional development? ‚Ü≥ If a coach isn‚Äôt within budget, carve out time to watch speakers you enjoy. Scroll through TEDX and pull useful tidbits of information from speakers you admire. Every speaker is reusing the same structure. You just have to find yours and make it your own. üí°¬†Personal plug: I‚Äôve been working with a coach all year, and I can‚Äôt wait to debut my new and improved speaking strategies at my next event (details below!) Step 3. Handwritten Notes Are Your Friend! ‚Ü≥ I made the switch from digital focus to analog note cards ‚Ü≥ The faster you can write them, the faster you will recall them üí°¬†Pro tip: Butterflies are normal.

"Hot take: Your corporate job is not your life‚Äôs purpose. It‚Äôs your training ground. No matter how many five-year plans you map out in your Notes app, life doesn‚Äôt follow a formula. As a former consultant, I saw firsthand how much consulting can use you‚Äî long hours, 70-slide decks, nights at the Holiday Inn Express in the middle of Missouri (just me?). What if YOU used consulting instead? Every time I talk about the Corporate Natalie evolution, I‚Äôm reminded how wildly unpredictable (and low-key magical?) this journey has been. I now get to do exactly what I want in my life and career, and I owe that to the skills I picked up when I was still figuring it all out. Without realizing it, I was job crafting‚Äîaka reshaping my role to align with my long-term goals. ‚û°Ô∏è Building decks? I learned to consolidate information. ‚û°Ô∏è Traveling weekly? I can work from basically anywhere. ‚û°Ô∏è Using Excel? Learned I‚Äôll never touch that againüòÇ ‚û°Ô∏è Working with small teams? I now run one. If you‚Äôre feeling stuck in your first 9-to-5 job, start looking at it as your launchpad, not your life sentence. Explore job crafting. Reframe how you think about your daily tasks. You might be building your dream career without even knowing it. I dropped a study on job crafting in the comments if you want to explore this topic further.

"BIG UPDATEüö®: I hired my second full-time employee! The inevitable hit me and Annie V. late last year: we surrendered to the fact that we couldn‚Äôt do everything ourselves. For any small business owner, hiring is insanely stressful. You think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been doing everything myself for so long - how am I supposed to trust someone with my vision, and trust that they‚Äôll execute?‚Äù For me, take that, and add in the fact that my company‚Äôs primary method of income is tied directly to my face (brand deals, speaking engagements, creator relationships, organic social posting, podcasting, consulting etc.). The pressure of selecting the right person felt SCARY. Back in December, Annie and I stared blankly at each other over Zoom wondering how we‚Äôd find someone. If we posted the application to two million+ people, we would never find the time to sift through them. How do we screen for the type of person we want without having to take hundreds of intro calls? Enter Colleen Pelly , co-founder of The Linchpin Co. , who‚Äîalong with Samantha Gibson and their incredible team‚Äîtook our chaos and turned it into a calm, thoughtful hiring process. They helped us clarify our goals, defined our dream candidate, vetted hundreds of individuals, and created a customized case study to test for exactly what we were looking for. They handled it all so we could focus on everything else that keeps Corporate Natalie LLC running. After just twenty-seven days, they screened thirty three candidates, set up interviews for seven incredible individuals, moved four to the final interview round, and extended an offer to our new Content Specialist. This is literally NOT an ad, but if you‚Äôre a small business looking to grow your team, you‚Äôd be missing out if you didn‚Äôt work with The Linchpin Co. We‚Äôre so excited to officially welcome our new Content Specialist to the team!

"There are two kinds of people on LinkedIn: creators and connectors. Figuring out which one you are is key to growing your professional presence and‚Äîbuzzword alert‚Äîyour personal brand. This was the focus of my discussion last week with Cindy P. Muir (Zapata) for the University of Notre Dame - Mendoza College of Business . As a graduate of the University of Notre Dame , it was surreal to speak to the early-in-career individuals who were sitting exactly where I was seven years ago. Becoming a content creator was the last thing I thought I‚Äôd do after graduating from ND. At the time, I knew I wanted to be a consultant (despite not knowing what the hell consulting was). Fast-forward through my wild career ride‚Äîconsulting ‚Üí cybersecurity ‚Üí content creation‚Äîand now I get asked all the time how I built my personal brand. I used to say, ‚ÄúJust post on LinkedIn!‚Äù But let‚Äôs be real‚Äînot everyone wants to be a content creator. And that‚Äôs perfectly okay. If you're a creator, you thrive on sharing ideas, storytelling, and taking risks. You want to put things out there. If you're a connector, the idea of posting publicly might make you want to shrivel up and die‚Äîbut you‚Äôre brilliant at building strong relationships behind the scenes. You spend hours cultivating your personal network of resources and contacts, and when s*** hits the fan in your life or career, you have ten people to call. During the session, I encouraged the high-achieving, driven ND students to use LinkedIn to discover their style. Creators: Start posting more. Connectors: Send that message. Make that coffee chat ask. Nurture your network. Knowing who you are is the first step. Then? Get moving. Discussions like these are something I love about my career.

"When I was at a bar this past weekend, someone asked me ‚ÄúWhat the hell do you do all week?‚Äù Honestly, great question, but sadly, in this job, no two weeks are the same. Take last week for example: I flew to Austin for SXSW to film content at the NOBULL activation. I spent five hours at the booth filming content, interacting with people as they came to the booth (and giving away free shoes), taking photos with followers, and chatting about collaboration ideas with the NOBULL team. I also snagged this pic from the professional photographer who was on-site, which I thought was a cool picture (beside the point). The content I posted promoting the shoes & the activation was seen by half a million people across channels (I‚Äôll link the post in the comments). I often lose sight of the numbers in this world, and forget the gravity of 500,000 people watching something I create.

"Happy International Women‚Äôs Day (1 day early) to all the badass women who are seeing this! As a female founder of two woman-owned and operated businesses, I want to shout out a few of the incredible women who have supported me in my career and life: Lauren Stafford Webb - Two hours after meeting Lauren in 2022, she said ‚ÄúAnything you need - I will support you.‚Äù I‚Äôve heard this before in many different contexts, most of which are empty promises, but never in a way that felt this genuine. Katie Welch - After joining a Rare Beauty shoot in LA, Katie offered to drive me to the airport. The CMO of Rare Beauty cleared her calendar to chat with me, mentor me, and offer invaluable advice for 45 minutes of her day that certainly could have been used elsewhere. This meant the world, and I‚Äôm lucky to call her a mentor to this day! Victoria Garrick Browne - Victoria is one of my best friends since high school. When she began creating content in college, she told me ‚ÄúNatalie, you HAVE to try this. You‚Äôre so funny. I‚Äôll help you.‚Äù After I made my first video, she shipped me a ring light with a note that said ‚ÄúYou got this!‚Äù Instead of feeling threatened that I was coming into her territory (she had been a creator far longer than me), Victoria welcomed me with open arms. You can listen to our @demotedpodcast episode this week if you want to hear more about our story. Annie V. - Annie is the closest person to me. As my Brand Manager, we spend most of our weeks together, and if we aren‚Äôt together, we‚Äôre in close communication. We‚Äôve grown together in our three-year working relationship: Annie has taught me the power of hard work, the power of a healthy routine, and the importance of taking a beat and being proud of your accomplishments. I couldn‚Äôt run this business without her, and I‚Äôm thankful to her every day!

"If you‚Äôre an early-in-career individual and your manager hasn‚Äôt asked you about your 2025 career goals, my advice is to take the initiative and share your goals upward. If you have goals / milestones but you haven‚Äôt shared them to your manager, you might as well rip that page out of your notebook and throw it away. Goals that you don‚Äôt speak out loud won‚Äôt get the recognition they deserve, and most importantly, the support from the people above you to make it come to fruition. Now that the early-Jan madness has died down, it might be the perfect time to throw thirty minutes on your boss‚Äôs calendar to share your goals and ask how you can align them with the overall team strategy for the year. The Notion template screenshotted below is what Annie V. and I used in our Strategy Session this year. It allowed us to revisit 2024 and create a shared path for 2025. The personal goal line item is only if you feel comfortable - last year, Annie shared with me her goal of running a marathon - because she shared this with me, I was 100% bought in for her to take long runs on Fridays and shift our work schedule to ensure she could run safely in the daylight and meet her training goals. Maybe don‚Äôt tell your boss your goal of getting a girlfriend or scrolling TikTok less during the work day (take it from me, an over-sharer), but sharing personal goals can sometimes help your cause.

"After numerous times being late to work after staring at my closet thinking (or screaming) ‚ÄúI have nothing to wear,‚Äù I decided it was time to do something about it. Today, I launched a workwear line!!! I met with Demi Marchese , CEO of 12th Tribe , in early 2024 with a dream of creating a collection of chic, affordable, and versatile workwear staples. Many trips to LA, deep-dives into DMs sharing fashion woes, fit meetings and photoshoots later, the ‚ÄúOffice Hours to Happy Hour‚Äù collection is officially live. This line has it all‚Äîfrom comfortable and classy dresses to power blazer sets, everyday blouses, and tailored slacks. My goal was to make dressing for your 9-to-5 both easy and empowering. Traditional workwear is uncomfortable, and current attempts at workwear miss the mark (like when mini skirts pop up when you search ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù on your favorite clothing sites?).

"‚ÄúDo not leave the airport. We need to get you out of there.‚Äù This was the text I received from my manager last Wednesday after I had touched down in Los Angeles. I flew to Los Angeles for a commercial shoot (that I was shocked was still happening), and kept turning off my news alerts and lying to myself that everything was going to be okay. As we got closer to landing, outside of my plane window, I could see smoke and flames. It was apocalyptic. Right as I touched down and got cell service, I received word from the crew that the Hollywood Hills fire had just started, and the shoot had to be cancelled. Within minutes my hotel was in an evacuation zone, and my team was looking for the first flight out because it wasn‚Äôt safe to be there. While this experience was absolutely nothing compared to the devastation happening across LA, I felt called to action to do something. It felt unfair that while I was able to book a flight home, back to safety, hundreds of people didn‚Äôt even have a place to call home anymore. As a California native, LA holds a special place in my heart, as I know it does for so many around me in the Bay Area. It sounds clich√©, but moments like these‚Äîwhen uncontrollable wildfires erupt and devastating losses occur‚Äîremind us that our jobs are far from the most important things about us. I called Annie and said we had to pause work. I posted on my story asking if people knew about any donation centers or initiatives happening in the Bay Area to provide relief to LA. Within hours, a fellow SF creator, Jessi Caparella , reached out to me to team up and try to make something happen. We reached out to Roadway Moving to get a 26ft truck to a parking lot in Emeryville, and Jessi and I posted on our Instagram stories informing people to show up with donations, if they had them, on Sunday. Within an hour, traffic was gridlocked down to the highway, we had enough donations to fill the truck, and we had to shut down the drive (a great problem to have!). Together, we gathered new and gently used items from the Bay Area, packed them up, and coordinated with the Roadway team to deliver them to a team on the ground in Los Angeles, currently set to receive them today. To say I was overwhelmed by the turnout would be an understatement. People got out of their cars, rolled their sleeves up, and helped for hours. I feel grateful for this community‚Äîthe people who went shopping for brand new toiletries, showed up, waited in line to give their donations, and got out of their cars to help. I felt love, strength, and support in every hug I received and every smile I saw. I may or may not have burst into tears when I got home from the drive‚Ä¶and then promptly crashed at 7 PM. I guess to add my LinkedIn ‚Äútakeaway‚Äù to this, if you feel called to act or help your community in any way, do it. It can easily get lost in the shuffle of the work grind, but don‚Äôt let it. Thank you to everyone who continues to care and show up for each other during difficult times!",7m,3125,51,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"It‚Äôs officially 2025, which means I‚Äôm beginning my annual rebrand. It‚Äôs crazy how one day can pass and all of the sudden, I‚Äôm reading a book a month, going to the gym every morning at 6AM, and starting a new skincare regimen. How long will these initiatives last you might be wondering? Well stop wondering. That‚Äôs a personal question. If you haven‚Äôt taken time to think about your personal 2025 goals, here are three easy ways to rebrand this year (‚Äúlow-hanging fruit‚Äù if corporate lingo is your first language): 1. Get a walking pad: You‚Äôve seen the Instagram ads. You‚Äôve been curious about it since the pandemic. Why not try it out this year? Just give your coworkers a warning that you might be a bouncing head on your next client call. 2. Stop catfishing people on LinkedIn: If you‚Äôre still rocking your headshot from 10+ years ago that barely resembles the person you are today, it might be time for a profile pic rebrand. You might have noticed my new profile picture, which I made through Notion Faces (linked in the comments below!). To me, a fun custom portrait helps you stand out in your workspace, and even spark up a fun convo about where it came from (these are all hand drawn by Notion‚Äôs original illustrator). Before you muster up the courage to book a headshot photo shoot, try out one of these cute illustrations for a few weeks! 3. Cook one meal per week: For the chefs reading this, this is child‚Äôs play. But for the DoorDash-addicted workaholics, this likely seems like your worst nightmare. Cooking has helped me get healthier, try new foods, and genuinely unplug for an hour each night. It‚Äôs the start of the year! Anything is possible! Oh, and if you want to have a matching profile picture to me, check out Notion faces at the link in my comments below :)",7m,719,40,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"What kind of manager do you want to be in 2025? While this seems like a massive task to create a brand for yourself not just as an employee, but as a manger too, I think it comes down to asking yourself a few questions: 1. What‚Äôre my views on work-life balance, and how do I want to model that to my team? I‚Äôm personally guilty of working ALL the time. I‚Äôm lucky with the nature of my job that it rarely feels like work to me, but if I don‚Äôt model truly stepping away to my employees, they‚Äôll never feel like they can! 2. Will you create time to bond with your teammates outside of work? Maybe this isn‚Äôt your vibe, but for my team, I want to implement quarterly team events that have NOTHING to do with work. 3. What motivates you, and what motivates your employees? Are these shared motivators? It‚Äôs okay if not, but how can you work towards aligning incentives in some small way?",7m,1912,63,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"‚ÄúSo Natalie, what do you do for work these days?‚Äù We all know it too well. The dreaded reality of the holiday season means having to re-explain to my entire extended family that I‚Äôm a‚Ä¶content creator? As I approach my fifth year of content creation (and my third year doing it full-time), I‚Äôve settled into a solid rhythm. I‚Äôm proud of the business I‚Äôve built, and I've accepted that perhaps my extended family and friends will never quite understand this ‚Äúsilly little Instagram thing.‚Äù My immediate family are my main supporters, and I‚Äôm thankful to have them by my side. If there is such a thing as a ‚ÄúNumber 1 Fan,‚Äù it would be my mom. Because some of you on here might be curious too, here are my three most-asked questions at the dinner table with answers: ‚ÄúDo you make any money doing this?‚Äù Yes. It‚Äôs crazy to think that I was able to leave my full-time job three years ago, but I was only able to make that leap because I knew I was making well beyond what I could have in the role I was in. ‚ÄúDo people recognize you on the street?‚Äù Sometimes! And it‚Äôs still CRAZY to me. One time, a girl in my local coffee shop came up to me and said ‚ÄúUm hello b****? Are you gonna say hi to me?‚Äù In true improv fashion, I immediately screamed ‚ÄúUm of course I am! Hi b****!‚Äù and started racking my brain for when I may have met this woman. She then experienced what can only be described as an out-of-body exorcism and started profusely apologizing (and swearing) saying a fluster of words including ‚ÄúHoly sh** you‚Äôre Corporate Natalie. I literally feel like I know you because I watch your content every day and thought we were friends.‚Äù To date, this was the best fan interaction I‚Äôve ever had. If you‚Äôre reading this, love you b****. ‚ÄúHave you met any famous people?‚Äù Yes. I still feel ‚Äúpinch me‚Äù moments every day. This year, I was able to work alongside Charlie Puth playing the role of his ‚ÄúMomager‚Äù in an unscripted reality series about his life. I filmed a Dunkin Donuts commercial with Will Arnett. And my personal favorite, I was in the same room as Ariana Grande at the Wicked premiere (I didn‚Äôt even talk to her, but I felt the need to share that). So, to any of you struggling with explaining what you do to your family, remember: The only person who truly needs to understand what you do is you. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs your job‚Äîand why you‚Äôre crushing it!",8m,2674,65,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"‚ÄòBrain Rot‚Äô is one of my biggest fears‚Ä¶but I also contribute to it by posting videos every day. Oxford University Press announced its 2024 Word of the Year: Brain Rot. The definition? ‚ÄúThe supposed deterioration of a person‚Äôs mental or intellectual state‚Äù from ‚Äúoverconsumption of online content considered to be trivial or unchallenging.‚Äù (Check the article in the comments for more!) As I continue to post short-form video content every day, my time aimlessly scrolling on social media increases in parallel. I sometimes claim it‚Äôs justified because I‚Äôm ‚Äúresearching‚Äù / ‚Äútrend forecasting‚Äù, but let‚Äôs be honest‚Ä¶that‚Äôs BS. I find my nightly routine is now tied to my scroll-induced serotonin boost, and it scares me a bit that I make videos that could contribute to ‚ÄòBrain Rot‚Äô. As we head into the new year and begin to think about 2025 resolutions and goals, I‚Äôd like to share mine as a content creator and chronic scroller to hopefully provide some inspiration to any fellow scrollers reading this: I want to be intentional about the platforms I spend my time on: The solution to avoiding ‚ÄòBrain Rot‚Äô might be tied to the platform I‚Äôm using to write this post. On LinkedIn, I engage in meaningful, thought-provoking conversations‚Äîsometimes data-driven‚Äîabout work, life, and everything in between. I always come away learning something new, and when I step away from a LinkedIn scroll, I don‚Äôt feel the same mind-numbing feeling that I do on TikTok (sorry TikTok). I want to make more ‚Äúhigh-quality‚Äù content: As a creator, my platform is built on humorous short-form videos. I poke fun at the absurdities of corporate life, and I hope to bring a sliver of joy to people watching my videos. My goal for 2025 is to explore different forms of long-form content, like career advice videos, hacks for tackling your first job out of college, and how to build your personal brand. This is something that I‚Äôve started doing on LinkedIn, but my other platforms (cough cough Instagram, cough cough TikTok) are lacking in this department. I need to set boundaries around my consumption: My New Year‚Äôs Resolution for 2024 was to charge my phone in my office, instead of by my bedside table. In typical New Year‚Äôs Resolution fashion, I did this successfully in January, then a little less in February, and let‚Äôs just say now, the phone is basically parked under my pillow. I‚Äôm amending my goal for 2025 to charging it in the office three nights a week. A bit more ‚ÄúAttainable‚Äù on the SMART goal scale ;) I plan to check in with myself after consuming content. How do I feel when I put my phone down? Am I inspired, informed, or recharged? Or do I feel drained, anxious, or less confident? Couple of questions for you: How do you manage the balance between consuming entertaining content and maintaining your mental well-being? What high-quality content do you want to see more of from me in 2025?",8m,499,43,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"A few weeks ago, I shared a post about the importance of working with people you actually like‚Äîyou know, the ones who make meetings bearable and lunch breaks more fun. Saying you‚Äôre ‚Äúpassionate‚Äù about something is overplayed in corporate America, but if I had to die on one hill, I‚Äôd say THIS is what I‚Äôm passionate about. I truly believe that when you feel happy, fulfilled, and valued at work, you become the employee that management (and your peers) need you to be. Turns out, one of my favorite brand partners, Canva , is just as obsessed with this idea. This month, we teamed up to tackle a big question: what are the impacts of appreciation in the workplace? [cue photo of me with confetti gun] One question I get all the time is: how can employers keep employees engaged and thriving in remote or hybrid work setups? My top tip? Create a culture of appreciation. Canva‚Äôs recent study found that 94% of employees who feel appreciated actually love where they work (not just ‚Äúlike‚Äù‚Äîlove). The ‚ÄúL‚Äù word - AHHH! But here‚Äôs the kicker: three out of four employees still wish they felt more appreciated. For Gen Z, it‚Äôs even higher‚Äî83% are craving more recognition. Despite my satirical ‚ÄòGen Z Feedback series, we shouldn‚Äôt overlook this stat. Feeling inspired?

"Hang on‚Ä¶is that Corporate Natalie in a Kris Jenner wig on the big screen? Yes‚Ä¶yes it is. I‚Äôm sort of an‚Ä¶actress? Well, kind of. I played a part in the new Roku Series, The Charlie Puth Show üé¨ When Nicole Schloss reached out to me about being a part of this series, I audibly laughed. I‚Äôve never acted before (like, ever), so when she said, ‚ÄúWe want you to play the role of Charlie Puth‚Äôs ‚ÄòMomager‚Äô‚Äù in the same breath as ‚Äúthe show features Charlie Puth, Will Ferrell, and John Legend,‚Äù I logically freaked out. I said yes to the project immediately and began traveling to LA every week beginning in February. The coolest part about the show (besides my Kris Jenner wig) is that it was entirely unscripted. We‚Äôd sit with our producer, discuss where we wanted the scene to go, and within moments they‚Äôd be rolling the camera. Did I black out and forget everything I said? Of course I did. But now I (and all of you) can watch me slip into Momager madness publicly on TV (peep the link in the comments if you want to watchüòâ). While this acting foray might seem random (and it is), it taught me that I truly can do anything I set my mind to.

"Me again with another post about emceeing (that literally no one asked for). This time, I‚Äôve ditched the Dallas makeup and strapless top and settled on a more corporate-friendly look to emcee for a tiny, not-so-well-known company called Meta (ever heard of it?). Last year, I had the privilege of emceeing with Jason Dailey at the Agency Summit, and I must‚Äôve done something right because I got the call to return for round two this year. Meta 's Agency Summits bring together agencies from across the globe to connect, learn from industry leaders, and gain invaluable insights to fuel growth - it also flew me across the country to tell a few jokes on stage, make a fool of myself, and have an Oprah moment while giving away free Meta Quest 3 Headsets (see pic of me below screaming ‚ÄúYOU GET A HEADSET! YOU GET A HEADSET!‚Äù). The summit gave strategies for boosting campaign performance, unlocked the secrets behind creative effectiveness, and referenced ‚ÄúAI‚Äù at least 1,000 times. Do I run an agency? No. Could I run a high-performing one now if I wanted to? Absolutely. Events like these remind me how important it is to get outside our home offices and interact with each other. Laughing and learning is always better done in a room full of strangers. Thank you, Meta , for hosting such an inspiring, informative, and entertaining summit!

"I know what you‚Äôre thinking: 'Natalie‚Ä¶don‚Äôt you usually post corporate videos? How did you end up on stage at a fashion conference? What‚Äôs that weird silver rock on your neck? Why are you wearing so much makeup?‚Äù All great questions. You‚Äôll have to ask my stylist about the rock necklace, and as for the makeup, they do things a little differently in Dallas (and I‚Äôm absolutely here for itüíÑ). Regardless, I'm beyond grateful to the team at LTK for allowing me to emcee their annual conference, LTKCon. For those of you interested in the inside scoop on the influencer world, this conference was INSANE. I‚Äôm not talking about free lanyards and backpacks branded with a random tech company logo. We‚Äôre talking branded ‚ÄòLTK‚Äô decals on every mirror in your hotel room (how‚Äôd they get into all those rooms?), free Beis bags full of LTK swag (why make content in the hotel robe when you can have one custom made for the conference?), Aritzia gift bags around every corner (not to brag, but Annie and I did get free Super Puff jackets), and ‚ÄúScan this QR code for $100 credit to [INSERT ANY BRAND YOU CAN THINK OF].‚Äù I‚Äôm not kidding‚Ä¶it was crazy (major shoutout to Aritzia , EVEREVE , Dynamite Clothing Spanx , adidas , and many more). If I woke up with the LTK logo tattooed on my arm I wouldn‚Äôt have been surprised. Now that‚Äôs a conference I can get behind. If you‚Äôve gotten this far in the post and you still don‚Äôt know what LTK is, my bad for making you wait this long. Whenever you see your favorite influencer link their outfit, they‚Äôre likely doing it through LTK. It allows creators to get commission by linking their favorite brands and allows followers to shop the looks of the creators they follow. Not only did I walk away from this conference with a huge smile and a bag full of goodies, but I‚Äôm also feeling fired up to post more on my LTK.

"Before Corporate Natalie, there was Deloitte Consultant Natalie (spooky‚Ä¶I know). Before the cross-country travel, 80-hour work weeks, and influx of Marriott Bonvoy points began, I first had to prep for the dreaded case interview. If any of you reading this are consultants, apologies for the shiver that just ran down your spine. As a college sophomore at the time, I didn‚Äôt know anything about anything (still don‚Äôt, but that‚Äôs beside the point). How was I supposed to listen to a case and know what the hell to do when my recruiter asked me questions? Did I read the textbook that everyone gets to make sure I was prepped? Of course I did. Did it help when I got to the interview? Not really. That‚Äôs why when Sydney Henriques reached out about his startup, Aurora Prep , a platform that gives real-time feedback for case interview preparation, I knew I wanted to be part of it. I'm thrilled to announce (sorry for the LinkedIn lingo - couldn‚Äôt help myself) that I‚Äôll be joining the Aurora Prep team as an advisor, contributing to the evolution of a platform designed specifically for students at all levels.

"Now that I've (kind of) mastered the art of waking up early (4 days/week counts, right?), I can't imagine how I ever managed to be productive without it. It‚Äôs become almost addictive‚Äîthe more I accomplish in those quiet morning hours, the more I find myself seeking out similar life hacks to boost productivity and bring ease to my routine.¬†Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing so far: 1. Pick out (and try on) your work outfit for the next day the night before. Nothing is worse than scrambling around your room when you‚Äôre in a rush because the outfit you had ‚Äúplanned in your head‚Äù didn‚Äôt quite work out. And then your room turns into a tornado of a mess while frantically trying things on. This can save you 15 extra precious minutes in your cozy bed and probably some stress wrinkles. 2. Make the most of your commute time by getting administrative tasks done. Personally, I like to use my commute to edit videos or respond to emails I‚Äôve been putting off. Even if it‚Äôs hard to focus amidst the chaos of traveling, it doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt check items off your to-do list. Plus, you can also cap in your commute price with Lyft . YEAH, you heard that right. Lyft has released a new feature where you can essentially pay a small fee to cap the price for your daily commute. I can‚Äôt even begin to express how much stress this saves me each morning when I don‚Äôt have to stress about ‚Äúsaving time to park‚Äù and opening and closing the app to see what time I should leave based on the lower fare price. Truly life-changing. If you take one hack from this post, it‚Äôs this one. Check it out in the comments below! 3. Meal. Prep. I know what you‚Äôre thinking‚Ä¶Natalie? Are you suddenly a gym influencer? Unfortunately, no. But I truly think every human can benefit from meal prepping. And rather than just picking one meal to eat for the whole week (because that‚Äôs boring, let‚Äôs be honest), I suggest prepping individual proteins and sides so that you can mix and match to keep your lunches and dinners interesting. Ground turkey + a side of roasted peppers can be put into a taco bowl on Tuesday and made into a pasta sauce on Wednesday. Done. Pro-tip: listen to your favorite podcast or watch a show and make this a weekly routine you LOVE on a Sunday! hashtag # LyftPartner",11m,701,38,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"The hardest part about the Olympics being over is that I no longer have an excuse to have my TV on during my workday‚Ä¶I do, however, feel a renewed sense of motivation for my daily grind. Although sending a follow-up email can‚Äôt quite compare to the challenge of finishing the 1500M Freestyle in 15 minutes, here are three takeaways from this year‚Äôs Games that you can apply to your (far less exciting) work day: 1. This one is for all you weekend warriors (the always-on folks): Sometimes taking a step back is the only way to move forward. If Simone Biles hadn‚Äôt stepped away from the Tokyo games and prioritized her mental health, she wouldn‚Äôt be walking away with more Olympic medals (and the G.O.A.T title) this year. 2. Forgive me for the cheesiness here but‚Ä¶teamwork really makes the dream work. Enough said there. We can all stop cringing now 3. It‚Äôs never too late to try something new. Kristen Faulkner, who started cycling in 2017, won the first Olympic medal in 40 years (a GOLD) in the Women‚Äôs Road Race. She only started seriously pursuing the sport in 2020. If you want to make a career pivot but think it may be too late, reconsider.

"Mike Tirico said ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù on live TV, and I‚Äôm absolutely living for it. NBCUniversal hired Alex Cooper to star as a host of the Games on Peacock . For those of you who aren‚Äôt OG Call Her Daddy fans, Cooper is a podcast host, influencer, and voice for women around the world. Some might think it‚Äôs an odd choice (and a risk) for NBC to bring her into the Paris studio, but I think it‚Äôs the perfect move to boost female viewership and bring an entirely new young audience to the Olympics. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I personally haven‚Äôt been able to focus on any of my meetings since the Olympics began (separately, I‚Äôm seriously considering training to compete in table tennis in 2028, but I‚Äôll save that for another post).

"For anyone who has a hard time explaining the influencer industry to their peers (or dare I say parents - anyone else, or just me?), send them the article I linked in the comments below from CNBC . With Cannes Lions launching its first Creator program this year, providing an exclusive networking space for brands and creators, we‚Äôre beginning to see the significant impact the creator industry has had on advertising. This article offers a great overview of why and how creator marketing has become so influential. As someone who identifies as a ‚Äúcreator‚Äù and has seen first-hand the impact influencer marketing has on the brands I work with, I agree with the article‚Äôs projections that the industry is only going to grow. TL;DR, the industry is projected to grow to (an absolutely insane) $528 billion by 2030, so if you haven't yet explored this space, I‚Äôd recommend starting by (as an individual) following a few creators, and (as a brand) taking time to evaluate whether or not adding influencer marketing to your overall marketing strategy might be a worthwhile investment. For those of you who have specific questions that I may be able to help answer from a creator POV, feel free to reach out in my DMs!

"Ross Pomerantz and I have always joked about how fun it would be to get on stage with business leaders and grill them in front of a live audience. This `joke` finally became reality last month when we invited ZoomInfo 's CEO Henry Schuck onstage with us to answer everything from `what's the richest thing you've ever done` to `have you gotten botox?` Henry absolutely crushed it, and the show accomplished exactly what we hoped: humanize Henry, build community, and provide a platform to tell the stories you'll never hear in an All-Hands. Our hope for the Demoted Podcast Live Show is for companies to bring us onstage with their leaders to offer your employees and partners the chance to see your leaders in the hot seat!

"I was looking through an old to-do list and saw this note in my ‚ÄòRandom‚Äô section after being interviewed by Brendan Gahan and Keith Bendes on their podcast. When I met Brendan, he was thinking about the possibility of creating an agency to run successful influencer campaigns on LinkedIn. I was instantly intrigued, and emailed him right after our recording to get involved. I‚Äôm thrilled to announce (cue insanely cringey LinkedIn line) that I‚Äôm joining the Advisory Board of Creator Authority , the first-ever LinkedIn-specific influencer marketing agency. While other social media platforms seem to have it figured out, I have yet to see creators on LinkedIn truly understand how to make branded partnerships best perform on the platform. It‚Äôs odd too, because as a B2B influencer myself (a term I recently coined), LinkedIn is where actual decision-makers follow me. Running a campaign for Dell Technologies or Salesforce on TikTok is undoubtedly great for brand awareness, but is it actually moving the needle?

"This is a fantastic post. I always suggest advocating for a raise, especially when merited. I want to speak a bit more on ‚Äúquantifying your achievements‚Äù, because I often find this to be the most important part. Here‚Äôs a hack to make this process easier: track your receipts as you go. Every time you receive a positive email or note from a coworker, win a deal, innovate, lead an important meeting - whatever it may be, be sure to take note. I like to keep an ongoing record of the value I‚Äôve added to my team in a personal folder so that when it comes time to speak up for myself, I‚Äôm more than ready. P.S. - check out Robert Half ‚Äôs Salary Calculator if you‚Äôre looking for an accurate salary range as a starting off point (linked in the comments).

"Let‚Äôs say you want to propose a new project to your team. Or maybe you‚Äôre heading into your performance review and want to show up looking ~prepared~. Every company has their format, but as an ex-consultant, I‚Äôve spent quite some time building decks for client projects, proposals, and even my own performance reviews. If I‚Äôm ever trying to put thoughts together in my current job as a content creator, I‚Äôll first pull up blank slides (my teammate Annie V. has a love-hate relationship with my deck obsessionü•≤). I utilize slides for pitches to brands, advising strategies, internal performance reviews, training modules for my team, and post-mortems following partnerships. Here are four tips that I think make every deck better: 1. Identify the problem. Get to the point within the first two slides of your presentation in the form of a problem statement. Why should someone spend their precious time looking at this deck? If you‚Äôre proposing getting allocated more funds to support a team happy hour, the problem statement could be something witty like ‚ÄúWe do good work, but we don‚Äôt celebrate that enough.‚Äù Pro tip: keep this problem statement to one or two simple sentences. The more you elaborate on the problem, the trickier it becomes to solve. 2. Use icons. Wow‚Ä¶I‚Äôm SUCH a consultant. Icons make a boring slide interactive and easy to follow. 3. Provide data to substantiate your proposal. Why should your audience believe in your plan of action? Do you have examples from the past or case studies that you can reference? I recently pitched integrating a brand sponsorship into my Gen Z series. I built a slide that included statistics from both the series on my channels (link clicks, engagement, etc.) and Gen Z consumer behaviors as they related to the brand‚Äôs industry / product. 4. List your next steps. A proposal is not of value unless you‚Äôve provided actionable steps for all stakeholders. I always make next steps attributional by listing them in a 2-column table format (action item on the left, the person responsible on the right). Is this similar to how you organize your pitch decks?

"I often get asked my thoughts on AI as it relates to the creator economy. On a recent panel, I joked that I‚Äôm ‚Äújust waiting for a hotter, cooler AI version of myself to replace me so I can retire.‚Äù While this felt absurd coming out of my mouth in that moment, the more I read up on AI, the more realistic this ‚Äújoke‚Äù becomes. This past week I stumbled upon a fascinating Business Insider article (linked in the comments below) that does a great job of weighing the current pros and cons of using AI to develop content. While I‚Äôm sure these feelings will change dramatically as AI advances in the coming months/years, here are some of my fears, hopes, and thoughts on utilizing AI as a content creator: My fears: 1. Lights, Camera, Action‚Ä¶or not: I was recently visiting a friend in Miami and walked by a street that was filming a car chase scene for the new Bad Boys movie. The entire street was blocked off and we got to witness stunt drivers risk their lives to nearly collide (but of course get out of it at the last minute) over and over again. I was completely entranced watching this, but couldn‚Äôt help but think about the insanely high budget that it takes to make scenes like this - closing down busy streets and crews of 100+ people. With the technology we have now, will these in-person productions even get funding in the future? While I likely won‚Äôt be casted in the next action-packed drama, being on set is quite literally one of my biggest joys in life. It's such a unique environment, and I can‚Äôt imagine a world where this industry doesn‚Äôt exist! 2. Deep Fakes: You've likely seen examples in the past few months of how AI can take advantage of name and likeness data to create deep fakes - my personal obsession is the deep fake account of Tom Cruise on TikTok (@deeptomcruise for those interested). Of course I‚Äôm concerned at the possibility of my digital persona to be hijacked - especially with how much Corporate Natalie content exists online. What excites me: 1. Contract Reviews: My biggest pain point as a creator is reviewing and redlining contracts. It‚Äôs a fairly repeatable process in many ways, but does require reading & digesting 10-30 page documents weekly. I‚Äôve met with a handful of founders trying to tackle this administrative burden through AI, and I‚Äôm hopeful for innovations to come! 2. Content Ideation: I love to use chatGPT as a supplementary tool when it comes to ideating content. If you follow me, most of you have seen my Gen Z feedback videos. When scripting this series, I often turn to AI to help generate Gen Z lingo ideas to get the ball rolling. My hope is that I can continue to use available tools as a compliment to my current creative process, not necessarily a replacement. What are your thoughts on AI as it relates to content creation and creativity in general?",1y,295,23,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"Reporting back live from Asia with an update‚Ä¶I did it! I successfully completed my no-phone challenge of putting my phone away for one full day. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned: I am in-fact addicted to my phone: I can‚Äôt believe the amount of times my hand was reaching for my phone simply out of habit. I kept checking my purse to find it, and it even got to the point where my thumb felt useless without its daily scrolling motions. This was a huge wake-up call for me. I actually did miss some important things: Despite loads of preparation, warnings to friends and family, etc., I did end up missing a few notifications. I missed a calendar notification for the birthday of a friend from college. I forgot to take my nightly medicine. I missed a group text from friends planning a trip. While these things weren‚Äôt life or death, it was a bummer to seem careless and and feel disconnected for even a moment. I use my phone to remind me to wake up, take daily vitamins/supplements, send follow ups for work, pay bills, and everything in between. It‚Äôs hard to imagine a world where I could cut out my phone entirely, but my time offline encouraged me to build some redundancy in my notification process outside of my phone. If anyone reading this has a planner recommendation, please let me know! I engaged more with those around me (shocking!): For a large portion of my day off, I was with a group of friends on a bus seeing multiple sites through Bali. With my phone, I would have absolutely used that transition time to scroll, however without it I was able to engage in deep conversation with those around me. It takes preparation and genuine effort to fully unplug: This was quite literally what I expected - a true challenge. I actively had to fight my brain from convincing myself to ‚Äújust check my phone once to see if everything was okay‚Äù or ‚Äúallow myself 5 minutes to scratch the itch so that I‚Äôd feel better‚Äù. We are SO reliant on staying updated and educated about what‚Äôs happening around us in our lives and although that is a super positive aspect about humanity, it can also become an unhealthy addiction. It‚Äôs safe to say that if I‚Äôve learned anything, it‚Äôs that we all need to do phone cleanses more often than we think we do. If you‚Äôre able to, I challenge you to try it out this coming weekend!",1y,600,26,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"Hello from Asia! That‚Äôs right, Corporate Natalie is OOO! I‚Äôm taking two weeks off to travel to Bali and Tokyo, and it‚Äôs been exactly the reset I‚Äôve been craving. Not only do I want to encourage you to take time off to improve your well-being, avoid burnout, and promote long-term productivity, but I also want to share how I‚Äôve been allowing myself space to unwind this week. No-phone challenge: I don‚Äôt know about you, but when it comes to my phone, I‚Äôm absolutely addicted. This week in Bali, I‚Äôm challenging myself to take two full days away from my phone. I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit, I‚Äôve never done a phone cleanse - it‚Äôs just not something I‚Äôve thought about, but now more than ever I‚Äôm realizing I need this. My job not only demands that I create on social media platforms daily, but I personally scroll constantly as a means to find new trends, keep up with platform by platform changes, and yes, get a bit of a serotonin boost. I‚Äôm ready to embrace living in the moment with the people I love in a new city. If humans were able to survive every day without their phones before technology existed, so can I? I‚Äôll be sure to report back with an update next week. Unrestricted sleep: Of course I allow myself to sleep in on light days/weekends, but I very rarely wake up naturally without a blaring alarm signaling to me that it‚Äôs time to start my day. It‚Äôs so rare that I‚Äôm able to get consecutive nights of quality sleep, so I‚Äôm determined to use this time away to make sure I get at least eight hours of sleep each night. I‚Äôve been reading about the importance of sleep and how it transfers to overall happiness in all areas of your life, so I‚Äôm attempting to not use an alarm this trip to let my body recover. Catching up on work before returning to work: This is one of my pro tips when it comes to taking time off. I used to get so stressed out when I was OOO because I‚Äôd anticipate all of the work I‚Äôd have to ultimately catch up on upon my return. Now, whenever I book a trip, I make sure that I get home at least 1-2 days before my OOO ends so that I can get myself situated with work and make that Monday back just that much easier.

"If you‚Äôre a people pleaser like me, you likely have a challenging time saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù - especially when it comes to work opportunities.

"A very talented woman once said‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWho Run the World? GIRLS‚Äù I feel incredibly lucky to have had such brilliant and empowering women managing me early in my career. In honor of International Women‚Äôs Day, I want to take a moment to reflect on the attributes these women share that impact my own management style today: 1. Give kudos (when deserved):¬† From a small ‚Äúthanks for helping schedule this meeting‚Äù to ‚Äúthank you for all your hard work this week,‚Äù the female managers I've loved have never shied away from giving me positive affirmation. Women should uplift each other in the workplace. We win when we all win together! Period. 2. Allow space for emotion: Women can feel very deeply, so checking in with your employees to see how they are doing and address concerns or relieve emotions will not only make them feel valued, but will also help to get ahead of potential roadblocks to team productivity. 3. Make room at the table: I felt so empowered when my manager, who knew how much I had contributed to a specific project, made room for me in meetings where others didn‚Äôt initially include me. It can‚Äôt hurt to add someone to a meeting who may have a fresh perspective on a topic they‚Äôve spent time researching. 4. Trust your employees to take a first pass! There‚Äôs no denying that it can be challenging to not micromanage every aspect of an initiative that you‚Äôre passionate about. However, when you allow your employees to take the lead on projects, it creates more effective workflows and lines of communications down the road. Trying and failing is how I learned from all of my mistakes throughout my career! 5. Remember that your work-life balance, priorities, and habits translate to your employees. Be mindful of how you lead in this way!

"From Beyonce ‚Äúbreaking the internet‚Äù to Ben Afflek‚Äôs Dunkin appearance, the 2024 Super Bowl ads did not disappoint. One commercial in particular stood out to me, and I‚Äôd like to unpack why. If you haven‚Äôt seen the Judge Beauty commercial by E.L.F. BEAUTY , check out the link in the comments below. Here are three reasons this commercial stood out to me: 1. Cultural relevance: Most people interested in purchasing Elf Cosmetics are likely on TikTok, which is why Elf Cosmetics did not miss the opportunity to include cameos from social media stars Benny Drama, Ronald Gladden, Meghan Trainor, Heidi N Closet, and Emmanuel Acho. Not to mention that everyone and their mother has been watching Suits since its release on Netflix in 2023. With a full nine seasons of the show, the two characters leading this commercial have become consistent figures in many viewers‚Äô daily lives. Elf took advantage of this familiarity and comfort, and linked it with their brand to boost positive affinity seamlessly. 2. Explicitly addressing the narrative: Good makeup is expensive, and although Elf Beauty is more affordable than most brands, consumers don‚Äôt like to sacrifice the quality of their glam. This statement is simple and evident in this commercial. When given one full minute to promote a product, many marketing teams make their best effort to pack in as many value propositions as possible. Although this approach can be effective in certain situations, I‚Äôd argue that diving deeper into one key message in an entertaining and thorough manner (like Elf did here) leaves the audience with an unmistakable next step to purchase the product if they resonate with the issue presented. 3. Story first, product second: Clear product placement doesn‚Äôt appear until the 43 second mark in this commercial. The Elf team was confident that by providing an engaging storyline first, viewers would stay engaged until the last quarter of the commercial, where they could then insert their product as a definite solution to the problem, and subtly push their desired messaging. Well done, e.l.f.!",1y,720,17,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"A few weeks ago, Vaval Victor, m.s. of AdWeek wrote this super insightful article on how Gen Z views advertising, and how that could shift the way marketing teams approach their strategies. As a cusp Gen Z/millennial and brand marketer myself, this article deeply resonated with me. The fact of the matter is that Gen Z is turned away by blatant advertising, cares way more than brands think about their company values, and will more likely turn to other consumers for testimonials when deciding to purchase a product. This leaves marketing teams in a position to innovate yet again. Here are the tips this article gave for adjusting your team‚Äôs advertising approach to Gen Z consumer behaviors: 1. ‚ÄúTurn-off signals in ad copy are disruptive‚Äù: As an influencer who creates sponsored ads for a living, my main objective is keeping my audience engaged. My goal is to make the video feel like any of my other skits, because that‚Äôs what my followers love. As a brand, one way you can mirror this practice is by having a consistent ‚Äúhook‚Äù at the beginning of your video content. The hook shouldn‚Äôt address your product in any way, rather the problem your product is solving. For example, if you‚Äôre selling a water bottle, start off by asking your viewer if they know what proper hydration feels like. 2. ‚ÄúCustomer experiences are key for brand credibility‚Äù: Studies have shown that about 40% of Americans use TikTok as their search engine tool instead of Google. It‚Äôs crucial that your team monitors the overall sentiment of your brand on TikTok and other social platforms, as these platforms do have power to sway consumer behavior (source linked below). 3. ‚ÄúBrand values matter as much as the product‚Äù: Let‚Äôs say your company values teamwork and innovation. Great! Gen Z will be eager to hear a story about a time when your organization came together to solve a problem in a creative way. These stories should not just be congratulated internally in company all-hands meetings, but rather shared with the public. Proof of impact is likely to garner more positive brand affinity than a video displaying your product‚Äôs features. 4. ‚ÄúGreat creative is remembered‚Äù: Gen Z can sniff an advertisement from a mile away. Their time is precious, and with so much content at their hands, they will not be spending that time watching your ad unless it entertains them. Rather than strategizing promotional content through the lens of how to effectively get the key messages across, shift your attention to how to entertain your audience first, and then embed your product in the most organic way possible. If your company is working to target a Gen Z audience, I‚Äôd start with these four strategies. I‚Äôd love to hear some additional tips in the comments below!",1y,98,9,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"A few weeks ago I posted about becoming an individual creator, and I received some messages asking how this model applies to businesses trying to create content for their brands. If improving both quality and quantity of social media content is on your organization‚Äôs list for 2024, here are three concrete steps for you to get started: 1. Encourage Employee Generated Content (EGC): Employee-generated content (EGC) is a form of content that is created and distributed by your company‚Äôs internal workforce. My favorite videos on TikTok are ‚ÄúDay in my Life‚Äù videos of people working in different industries. Everyone has a phone, so encouraging your employees to post about their job on social media is a great way to generate content for your social channels. 2. Hire an in-house creator: Hire someone who is a good visual embodiment of your company culture to create video content. Visual embodiment can mean a bunch of different things. This individual could be a skilled employee on the marketing team or even a mascot like Duolingo ‚Äôs. When recruiting this individual, my suggestion would be to choose someone that is part of or as close to Gen Z as possible to ensure that they have fluency in social media and are consistently exposed to up-and-coming trends. 3. Get cozy with legal: Once you‚Äôve acquired your in-house creator and/or identified some employees working on EGC, set up a solid process flow between them and a legal representative within the organization. Social media is ever-changing, and for most companies, the biggest bottleneck to staying on trend with content is ensuring that assets are legally compliant. The sooner you can establish a relationship with your legal team and form a relatively seamless approval process for content, the more content you‚Äôll be able to publish. 4. Schedule your content: If you're feeling stuck on what type of content to start with, try scheduling out your content around large cultural events or holidays. For example, how can your team incorporate your product into a meme surrounding the upcoming SuperBowl? Cultural events bring communities together on social media, and this presents an amazing opportunity to showcase your product effectively if you can take advantage. Here are three dates to add to your social calendars right now: a.)Valentines Day (Wednesday February 14th):If your brand offers products or services that make for great gifts, Valentine's Day could be an excellent theme to focus on. b.) International Women‚Äôs Day (Friday March 8th): Demonstrate your endorsement for initiatives and causes supporting women, and feature your products and services customized for the female audience. c.) Earth Day (Monday April 22nd): Have any sustainability initiatives your company wants to highlight? Earth Day is the perfect time to post about them! Some of your content will fail, but be sure to take those learnings into consideration with your next round of content and just. keep. testing. You‚Äôll get there!",1y,335,16,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"It seems like EVERYONE is all of the sudden a content creator. Every day I scroll through my favorite social media apps, I see more and more people try out posting video content. From a simple ‚ÄúGet Ready with Me‚Äù to a more intricate cooking video, you might be curious how you can start to show the world what you have to say. If one of your personal goals for 2024 involves content creation, listen UP. I‚Äôm no pro, but if I could have advised my pandemic-posting self, I would have given her these three recommendations: Do: Calendar block your filming and editing sessions for at least the next month. If I could only give one piece of advice regarding social growth, it would be to stay consistent (at least one post per day when first starting out). Your most important tool is time, especially when starting to create content alongside a full-time job. It‚Äôs crucial to have time carved out. Buy: Buy editing software to make your workflow easier. I highly recommend trying out CapCut for basic editing, and upgrading your app once you get the hang of your editing style and want to access more features. It‚Äôs been my go-to for years! Also buy a ring light - there‚Äôs nothing worse than dark/pixelated videos - plus you‚Äôll be able to brighten up your face on work calls in parallel! Follow: Follow influencer industry news. This space is constantly changing, and more often than not, those who constantly think a few steps ahead are the ones that have a better chance at success. If you‚Äôre looking for somewhere to start, two of my favorite resources to keep up with industry knowledge are the The Publish Press and Social Media Today, LLC ( https://lnkd.in/g7YTJmbk ).

"One of my goals for 2024 is to celebrate my accomplishments more often. I feel like we tend to get so caught up in the day-to-day that we rarely sit down and allow ourselves to say ‚ÄúWow. That was awesome. I‚Äôm proud of myself.‚Äù So to get a head start on my first goal of the new year, I wanted to reflect a bit on this past year. Here are some of my favorite memories and achievements: Speaking: I went into this year with a goal of speaking more at conferences, universities, and company events. While being in front of the camera is incredibly fun, my most fulfilling moments from 2023 were getting to engage with my community live and in-person, and share my story in a more tangible way. I‚Äôm proud to say that this year I‚Äôve been able to speak at Harvard University , Indeed FutureWorks, SXSW with Dell Technologies , Meta , Intuit , TikTok , Starbucks , Square , and many more. Thank you to all of the incredible teams who welcomed me with open arms at your events! Half Marathon: No, it wasn't a full marathon, but dang that was hard. Thank you Strava for encouraging me to run a distance I didn't think was humanly possible. Next stop‚Ä¶marathon? (jk) Paycom Commercial: If you were watching any major sporting events last year and didn't completely tune out during the commercial break, you likely saw me in a Paycom commercial sitting poolside with a pineapple drink in my lap. My first commercial shoot in 2022 with Paycom was an experience I'll remember forever. It was my first time on set, with a crew of forty people supporting me. This year, I did a second round of commercials with Paycom, and I couldn't be more proud! Check them out here: https://shorturl.at/mvIJ3 First Employee: At the beginning of 2023, I hired my first employee. Expanding my personal team at the age of 25 was something I never would have imagined for myself when I started my career at a Big 4 Consulting firm. Bringing on Annie V. has been the single best decision I've made in my career. She's helped me grow my business, think outside the box, improve my personal work-life balance, and have a true partner in this oftentimes lonely world of content creation. Taylor Swift: I'd be remiss if I didn't mention receiving the invite from SoFi to attend the #1 concert in the world. Taylor - you‚Äôre an icon, and SoFi , thank you for that unforgettable experience! Gen Z Feedback videos: This past year I started a highly successful series on my channel where I pretend to be a millennial boss giving feedback to my Gen Z employee. This series not only brought me joy in the content creation process but also showed me that it‚Äôs possible to try different styles of content. This year I expanded the boundaries of Corporate Natalie on my Instagram and TikTok into pickleball, mom content, dad content, ‚ÄúThe friend who‚Äù videos, and GRWM vlogs.

"When I spoke to Dell Technologies employees at SXSW earlier this year, a woman asked me how to deal with the awkwardness of being a manager to someone who is the same age as you. She mentioned feeling ‚Äúweird‚Äù telling someone she considers to be a friend about areas that they need to improve in. While I remember throwing together a sub-par answer at the moment, I‚Äôve taken a bit more time to think through my advice on this topic since being asked. I often speak on best practices for navigating the workplace under your boss and alongside your team. This past year, I‚Äôve also taken on the role of being a manager to my own team of similar-aged women to myself, while still feeling personally very ‚Äúearly‚Äù in my career. Take it from me: it can be a bit awkward providing face-to-face feedback with direct reports that are close to your age. For those of you in similar positions, here are three tips to make your next performance review with your DR a tad less difficult: Acknowledgement: As dumb as it sounds, acknowledging the awkwardness is often the best way to start these performance-based discussions with similar-aged direct reports. As the Queen of Self-Deprecation and telling bad jokes in tense moments, this comes quite naturally to me, but if it doesn‚Äôt for you, try starting the discussion with ‚Äúlook, I‚Äôm new to this too, so let‚Äôs work together on getting through the awkwardness.‚Äù Trust me, it lightens the mood. Two-way street: Create a level playing field from the start by acknowledging not only their positive attributes and growth, but also areas where you may be lacking in management. If you arrive at the review with nothing but a list of critical feedback and zero areas of potential self-improvement, I can almost guarantee that your employee will be less receptive to criticism and will lack motivation to make change. I always kick off my performance reviews with a slide on ‚ÄúThings I Suck At‚Äù to both provide a few laughs and open the floor for my employee to comment in a genuine way on ways I can manage better. Plus, with every negative critique in life, it hurts less if you say it first yourself ;) Future visibility: It‚Äôs important to always ask your employee about their long term aspirations and how you can support them more in achieving those dreams. Despite being the same age, there‚Äôs a reason you‚Äôre the one managing them! How can you show them that you can provide genuine value to their career? Can you introduce them to someone in the organization who can help them develop a certain skill? Can you allow them to shadow a project that piques their interest? It‚Äôs crucial for all employees to feel that they are on the path to success in their careers, and that their manager will support them in that, no matter what age they are.

"My thoughts on Return-to-Office policies: I'm often asked my perspective on companies requiring employees to return to the office 3-5 days per week, and I'd like to provide my thoughts alongside an article recently published by Indeed. Indeed‚Äôs CPO Priscilla Koranteng, believes that in order to get your employees excited to go back to the office, your company needs to be ‚Äúgiving people a place that they want to return to.‚Äù She also states that ‚ÄúThe most successful organizations today are embracing flexibility.‚Äù I wanted to double click into this a bit and provide three potential ways to encourage employees to¬†want¬†to come into the office: Anchor Days: Get all employees back into the office on the same days each week. A message I frequently receive from my community is something along the lines of ‚ÄúI go into the office and no one is there - what‚Äôs the point?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt agree more that going into an empty office feels like a huge waste of time. If I‚Äôm putting on makeup and commuting‚Ä¶I better at least be making some friends in the process. Indeed suggests establishing ‚Äúanchor days‚Äù to draw employees into the office at the same time. I couldn't agree more that this strategy helps foster an environment where employees can truly connect with each other and get increased value out of going into the office. Office Vibes: Let‚Äôs be real. The traditional corporate office setting of drab cubicles and a bleak breakroom are behind us. We‚Äôre used to working from the comfort of our bedrooms and home offices. Offices should work to provide a similar level of comfort to their employees. Cultivate an environment for your employees where they have space to socialize and collaborate, but also get work done productively. Pro tip: stock the office with some elite snacks. Everyone loves a freebie. Safe Weeks: Upon combing through messages from my corporate audience, one theme holds true: we want flexibility. My personal recommendation to achieve this would be giving employees a certain number of ‚Äúsafe weeks‚Äù each year where they are not required to go into the office nor explain why they can‚Äôt. One of the very few upsides of 2020 was that we could work from anywhere. I personally rented a beach house for a month so I could spend my mornings running on the beach before logging on. Giving employees ‚Äúsafe weeks‚Äù would allow them to work from their cabin for a week during ski season or work from their parents‚Äô home during Thanksgiving break without having to be in the office. It‚Äôs hard for employees to commit to in-office presence every single week. Providing ‚Äúsafe weeks‚Äù creates space and flexibility for your employees to get their work done in ways that work best for them.

"Yes. I have nearly 1300 unread emails. Oops. If you‚Äôre someone that experiences inbox anxiety, which I define as intense overwhelm when your number of unread emails exceeds an inhumane amount, this one‚Äôs for you. Here‚Äôs how I prioritize my daily inbox (highest priority to least likely to open): 1. Anything from my boss: There‚Äôs no scarier feeling than your boss saying ‚Äúdid you read my email?‚Äù and you have not in fact read the email. Of course, this demands immediate attention in my book. 2. Project assignments/updates: Anytime after 4:30pm, there‚Äôs no chance I‚Äôm opening these, but I‚Äôll definitely read the subject line to make sure I‚Äôm not missing anything marked ‚ÄúUrgent‚Äù. The next morning I‚Äôll be sure to caffeinate before I process the assignment and create an action list. 3. Meeting invites: While I typically leave these unopened and respond to meeting invites through my calendar (so annoying, I know), these are easy to open and accept, so just do yourself a favor and decrease that amount of unreads by one. 4. Newsletters: Why did I decide to sign up for 100 newsletters? Hopefully I‚Äôllget around to these‚Ä¶ next year? Lastly, the best inbox anxiety advice I once received was to acknowledge that when someone either inquires about something or responds to your email, they are inviting you to respond at your convenience. Oftentimes we view emails as commands and therefore, when they stack up, our to-do list burden gets heavier. However, if you‚Äôre able to shift your mindset and grasp that when that email hits your inbox, you have the ultimate power to determine the timing and priority of your response, inboxes get less intimidating.

"It‚Äôs officially conference season. Where was I last week? A conference. Where am I typing this from now? A conference. Where will I be next week? You already know. Conferences aren‚Äôt sprints. They‚Äôre absolute marathons. One second you‚Äôre walking into your first keynote at 8AM and the next you‚Äôre drinking your fifth vodka soda with your team at 11PM in the hotel lobby bar. I‚Äôve become so accustomed to the conference grind that I‚Äôve developed a list of must-have essentials for the full day of ~fun~. I know I‚Äôm not the only one partaking in this year‚Äôs season of all-day learning and networking, so here are the five items I bring to every work event: 1. Gum and/or mints: Do yourself a favor by packing both of these to counteract the coffee breath that you‚Äôll most certainly have. Be it from your three-hour time zone adjustment or 3PM lull before yet another keynote on AI, you‚Äôll certainly be downing coffee all day. Plus, you never know if that veggie wrap they gave you at the lunch buffet has garlic in it‚Ä¶ 2. Floss: You don‚Äôt want to be networking with a poppy seed in your tooth. Trust me. Do I have an obsession with oral hygiene? Perhaps. 3. Portable phone charger: You‚Äôre trying to download the weird app that the conference built while simultaneously getting the number of that person you met within your industry who you probably won‚Äôt end up getting coffee with. Regardless of what you‚Äôre doing or where you‚Äôre doing it, you‚Äôre going to need your phone. 4. Red-Eye Drops: This might just be a me thing, but when I‚Äôm racing through a dimly lit convention center, intermittently checking my bright laptop screen, and likely not drinking enough water, my eyes look completely bloodshot. I throw these bad boys in around 3PM to keep me looking sane through the night. 5. Ladies, this one‚Äôs for you‚Ä¶ Sneakers: I know those heels seemed like a good idea at 8am, but by 4PM you will be aching to take a seat and never get up again.

"Last week I posted a clip from my recent episode on the The Tom Ward Show that encouraged posting on LinkedIn, even if to simply diary your personal career experiences. I mentioned that many feel nervous to post unless they have highlights to share like a promotion or new job. In the past week, I‚Äôve done some digging on some of my favorite LinkedIn creators (shout out to Rod T. , Zaria Parvez , and Ross Pomerantz ) to see how they approach content sharing on LinkedIn. Plot twist: all of them embrace the occasional pitfalls and unproductive moments in their careers, and use LinkedIn to talk about the ‚Äúimperfect‚Äù moments that come with working in the corporate world. I feel a certain bond with these creators because they depict the humanity, grit, and oftentimes hilarity that come with the professional world. People often say that unfortunately ‚Äúsocial media is a highlight reel,‚Äù showing only the best moments of our lives. Maybe your superpower when it comes to posting on LinkedIn can be humanizing that highlight reel. Here are three prompts I‚Äôd encourage you to use as inspiration for a post on your channel this week: 1. What‚Äôs an embarrassing career moment? No, I‚Äôm not asking you to publicly post about getting too drunk at your company holiday party, rather, a learning moment that you can laugh about now. 2. What‚Äôs the most menial task you‚Äôve ever been asked to do? Maybe it‚Äôs shredding hundreds of documents, or perhaps aligning icons on a 50-slide deck. Whatever it may be, what did you learn in that moment? And if you learned nothing, what did you think about for those hours you spent near the paper shredder? 3. If I could start over your career, what would you do differently? Everyone on LinkedIn is curious about how to make the most of their careers - perhaps your learning might help someone who feels lost redirect to an even better career path - you never know!",1y,148,4,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"I‚Äôll straight up say it: the first year of my career, the only thing I did was take notes. If this is you, don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not alone. Given that note-taking quickly becomes a huge part of your early-in-career corporate identity, I thought I‚Äôd share some of my hacks for effective note-taking: 1. Copy the meeting agenda into your notes prior to the meeting. 2. Write down your questions as soon as they pop into your head. This way you‚Äôll be able to keep track if they‚Äôre answered later in the meeting. 3. Take five minutes to summarize key takeaways directly after the meeting.

"I'm not a Swiftie...but here's why Taylor Swift is a boss. This past Friday, I went to the Eras tour at SoFi stadium. I have to admit, I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call myself a ‚ÄúSwiftie,‚Äù but after seeing this absolutely unreal performance, I think all of us can learn a thing or two from Taylor. So, ‚ÄúAre You Ready For It?‚Äù 1.

"This past Sunday, I completed a half marathon that I‚Äôve trained for for months. If you‚Äôve been following my running journey on my socials, you already know that my training contained lots of highs, lows, laughs, moments of terror, and MANY social posts begging for kudos from my followers (what‚Äôs the point of running if everyone doesn‚Äôt know about it?). For you marathon runners out there, I‚Äôm sure a half marathon sounds like nothing, but let me tell you, this was HUGE for me. I went from never hitting more than 5,000 steps a day to prioritizing my fitness in ways I never thought were imaginable. Through this challenge, I‚Äôve recognized the importance of setting goals outside of your career. Here are my main takeaways: 1. It‚Äôs never the right time to set a challenge outside of work, so it‚Äôs not worth waiting for that perfect moment. I could have waited to start training until I ‚ÄúI had more time‚Äù or when work felt ‚Äúslow enough‚Äù to make time for myself. The reality is that the time was always there, I just needed to see it and use it. All I needed to do was categorize a block of time in my day that was solely for my personal goal and not my career-related goal. Pro tip: If you have a hard time justifying this block, pretend that you are scheduling a VERY important meeting with yourself that you can‚Äôt miss. 2. Even on my busiest work days, I found I was more productive and focused when I fit in a run. While I technically lost that extra hour of work, I noticed that my hours spent at my desk were 10x more productive when I‚Äôd sit down with a fresher mind. Taking time to push myself in my personal fitness goal allowed me to escape the ‚Äúwork chatter‚Äù constantly flooding my brain and be more efficient in the long-run. 3. After achieving my goal of finishing the race, I have a newfound confidence in my abilities both personally and professionally. I‚Äôve noticed myself welcoming ambitious ideas more frequently and getting excited about large-scale projects that I would have previously viewed as impossible. I‚Äôm sure any boss would be thrilled to have an employee with this mindset. This is your sign to do that thing outside of work that's been intriguing you. Give yourself that opportunity.

"This year I have been pushing myself well outside of my comfort zone of content creation by speaking across the country about my journey as a creator and how to achieve early-in-career success. Even though I feel UNBELIEVABLE butterflies before walking on stage, each speaking event gets easier as I master my routine for feeling comfortable and tailoring each conversation to each new audience. Whether you're preparing to speak to 500 people or simply sharing  new findings with your team at work, here are three tips for speaking in any setting: 1. Stay in the moment -- don't memorize your responses, but rather listen and respond. Remember, it's a conversation! Everything will run way more smoothly if you stop reading that script you tried to memorize. 2. Know your audience ‚Äì Whether you‚Äôre nervous about your one-on-one check-in with your boss or you‚Äôre speaking for the first time at a conference, knowing what motivates the people listening to you will help make your content more engaging.

"Ah. Another day in the office. For some it‚Äôs your home office a few steps away from your bed. For others it‚Äôs your office building that perhaps still doesn‚Äôt quite feel like it used to. Wherever you are, it‚Äôs likely the same coffee that‚Äôs barely doing it‚Äôs job, the same view that you were excited about for just the first 3 weeks but are now bored of, and an inbox full of emails that you told yourself you‚Äôd be more motivated to respond to today because you‚Äôd ‚Äúhave more energy‚Äù - news flash: you don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I LOVE what I do. But we‚Äôre all human, and it is totally normal to feel exhausted by doing what you love just as much as it energizes you. If you find yourself in this position, one of my favorite ways to pull myself out of a rut is to get around other people who are all passionate about what they do and eager to learn. What better way to do this than attend a conference? Not only do I get to see some new faces (no offense to sweet Cheryl in accounting who I smile at every single day), but I also get to learn new things and expand my horizons beyond anything possible within my average day-to-day. I‚Äôve been lucky enough to attend a few conferences this year, and every time I leave with my creative battery supercharged. If you‚Äôre looking for an opportunity to attend an impactful conference this year, you should absolutely check out INBOUND 2023 in Boston from September 6th-8th.

"Your inbox is overflowing, your calendar is full of meetings, you have a doctor‚Äôs appointment that will take who knows how long, a deck that you haven‚Äôt started for an important client meeting, and a family dinner that you need to be present for. Oh, and it‚Äôs the start of a new day where your list will undoubtedly at least double in size. These are the types of moments where I used to immediately gravitate towards isolation, caffeine and a whole bunch of ambitious time blocking to squeeze it all in. Until‚Ä¶my boss called me out on this get-it-done mentality. ‚ÄúYou want me to‚Ä¶not get my projects done? What?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I want you to get them done right.‚Äù This was a lesson I had to learn the hard way when my inability to say no took a toll on my work. This not only pushed me further in my career but also gave me reassurance that taking breaks is okay. Honor and communicate your bandwidth. Your team will grow a greater respect for you, you‚Äôll be prouder of your work, and you‚Äôll be happier overall - trust me. And if your employer doesn‚Äôt like that version of you, then the sooner you learn that lesson the better. Here are three quick tips if you‚Äôre feeling way too overwhelmed today: 1. Ask your manager which projects are the priority 2. Overestimate how long things will take you. I‚Äôm the first person to say ‚ÄúI can get that done ASAP!‚Äù when in actuality it takes me 45 minutes to align icons I didn‚Äôt account for. 3. Go to bed earlier. I always thought staying up late was the answer. After tons of trial and error, I‚Äôve realized waking up earlier is a way more productive solution. I also start my mornings with a quick walk to wake me up.",2y,1706,24,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"‚ÄúWhat exactly do you do?‚Äù I get this question quite a bit. When Corporate Natalie began, I was working a full-time job in tech (shortly after leaving my job in consulting). My comments section was flooded with curiosity around what my full-time job was, but I always worked to keep the two worlds separate. Since then, I‚Äôve been able to start two companies of my own, build out my resume as an advisor and consultant, and continue to create content that I‚Äôm excited about. As a Corporate Natalie video would likely make fun of, ‚ÄúI wear many hats.‚Äù If you‚Äôre interested, here‚Äôs what I do: 1. Content Creator: Of course, a large part of my week is dedicated to creating content for my Corporate Natalie pages. Content creation includes scripting, filming, editing, re-filming (if needed), posting, responding to comments, and reviewing post analytics.  Hope you like the jokes, because I love making videos. 2. Advisor: In growing my following and living in Silicon Valley, I‚Äôve developed a passion for working with early stage companies on social media strategies to see if the skills I‚Äôve learned as an individual creator can apply to various business accounts. Advising allows me to work directly with founders and marketing departments to effectively translate brand messaging across social media platforms. 3. Consultant: I‚Äôm incredibly invested in empowering creators around me to build the best business they can around their content, passions, and interests. I consult with creators across niches and social platforms on ways to charge equitable rates for brand deals, expand into different content niches, and create a solid foundation for growth across platforms. 4. Entrepreneur: I‚Äôve founded two companies since starting Corporate Natalie. The first is my in-house agency built to support the brand deal and speaking engagement lifecycle for Corporate Natalie (and soon to be other creators). I am not represented by any agencies or managers‚Ä¶I‚Äôve worked in sales, so I like handling the negotiations. I also founded a virtual assistant company that pairs influencers & creators with virtual assistants. Some of the creators in our network include Sarah (Stuckey) Steele , Mike R. Draper , Victoria Garrick Browne and more. After explaining my four focus areas on stage at a recent Q&A I joined, someone in the audience asked, ‚Äúare you afraid your jokes won‚Äôt land if you don‚Äôt have a full-time job?‚Äù I‚Äôm not, but if one day you decide you don‚Äôt like the jokes, I completely understand. While we don‚Äôt picture ‚Äúcontent creator,‚Äù as a role that would be sitting on Zoom calls most days of the week, I can assure you my desk is the place I spend most of my time. I‚Äôm thrilled that I get to work directly with brands and creative teams to develop content and content strategies for social growth. I‚Äôm excited about learning the ins and outs of building a business from the ground up. Most importantly, I‚Äôm thankful to be able to do what I love every day of the week.",2y,786,29,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE
"Any brand or creator striving for social growth knows that strategizing how to achieve their goals on any given platform can be extremely overwhelming. Here are the four questions you should ask yourself when looking to create content and grow a following: 1. Why should people follow you? In a few words, what do you generally want people to think/say/feel when they see your content? 2. What‚Äôs your video style? Do you communicate with your viewers direct to camera? Do you create through montage videos? What can your viewers count on when they see your video? 3. Do you have time to create and post at the cadence needed to promote growth? If you are going to do the thing, you need to make sure you can take on the large time commitment that comes with it. 4. Are you a native user of the social platform? Understand and keep up with platform trends to ensure that you can speak the language of the users on that platform.

"PSA: Balance looks different for everyone, and it doesn't need to be extreme. I keep seeing content that feels like your phone is screaming at you to be better at balance and being present in the moment...that you need to either cut social media off completely because it is ruining your life or never ever EVER work on PTO because you will regret it on your deathbed. Let me just disclaim that if you have been reading my content here you know that I am a HUGE advocate for shutting out social media/work when you need to spend time with family and friends doing what you love and what fills your cup. BUT...hot take.. some of this extreme advice to set strict boundaries may actually be causing you to feel even worse. What `overwhelms` each individual and takes away from the moment is completely subjective. For example, I know for me and my teammate, we love a quick Sunday email catch-up. And oftentimes, when people see me on my email on a Sunday or behind my laptop, they urge me to `enjoy my Sunday`, saying that `it will always be there tomorrow`. YES, it will be. YES, if you only get a few hours with your family and friends on Sunday you should NOT be doing work. BUT, what if you find yourself with¬†some extra free time and motivation to check your inbox, and that extra bit of work on a Sunday allows you to be more present to your roommates, spouse, children, coworkers, etc. later in the week? I'd argue that a healthy choice would be to go ahead and log on for a bit. Here is a trick I use when determining how best to utilize my time. Ask yourself `Does spending this amount of time on XYZ provide me with the ability to be present/recharged/excited for a longer period of time in the next few days or weeks, or does it take away more joy than it provides?` Simple, right? Maybe give it a go.",2y,450,7,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"I am so incredibly fortunate for all of my brand partners and all of the brands that consider me a great fit to market their products.

At the ripe age of 22 heading into my first job, I‚Äôd be lying if I said I was fully passionate about Business Continuity and Resilience.

"When I was interviewed this weekend at the Dell Technologies Experience at SXSW, an audience member asked me how I‚Äôve dealt with working in largely male dominated fields. I sat with the question for a bit as I thought through my experiences working in consulting and cybersecurity, on majority-male teams. My answer was simple: ‚Äúmy gender is the least interesting thing about me.‚Äù I‚Äôve been lucky to have worked with some incredibly supportive men throughout my career. I‚Äôve also come across some men who were not so supportive of my goals and ambitions as a hungry and confident woman early in her career. I chose to distance myself from these types of people, as I do with all relationships in my life. With Equal Pay Day being today, I wanted to take a moment to ask everyone to pause and reflect on their own experience in the workplace. If you feel as though you (a) are either viewed or paid differently due to your gender or (b) treat or have been treated differently due to your gender, I encourage you to seek professional guidance to work through this problem in your workplace or within yourself. It is absolutely not something that can or should be put aside or deprioritized due to any current workload - big or small. To my male followers, I encourage you to view the gender of your female coworkers as the least interesting thing about them.¬†Quick shout out to a few rockstar male mentors I‚Äôve had throughout the years: Steve Taylor , Casey Twenter , Jonathan Woytek hashtag # equalpayday hashtag # genderequality hashtag # workplaceequality hashtag # earlyincareer",2y,587,13,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"Last week SoFi asked me to fly across the country and capture some content on the streets of NYC. Having worked together before, the SoFi team knew three things about me: 1. I love improv: I‚Äôm unsure if it comes from my inability to memorize lines or my deep-seated desire to make everyone laugh, but improvising on the fly is one of my favorites things to do. For this reason, there was no script. I wish you could have seen the utter shock on my face when their creative team told me they didn‚Äôt write a script. The theme and general scene setup / art direction were of course there, but the lines themselves hadn‚Äôt been written. This approach was risky, so I was thankful that they trusted me to bring their vision to life without a clear guide of how to make it happen. 2. I enjoy working alongside bad-ass women: To carry out a production without a script, it‚Äôs vital to have directors who can quickly adapt and course-correct a completely improvised scene in the right direction. For the first time in my career (a sad reality that might require another post entirely), I had two female directors running the show. Thank you to Kelly Anne Bonner and Alex Anderson (now ‚ÄúKalex‚Äù to me) for being fiercely creative in your pursuit of incredible content! I hope this is the first of many times we work together 3. I can certainly rock a blazer set: The first piece I tried on in my fitting was a vibrant blue blazer set that our Art Director Alex envisioned well before the shoot began. Not only did it perfectly match the trucks we drove around on set, but it also looked awesome (see pic below). It garnered the attention of nearly every passerby on the busy streets of New York and even allowed for some impromptu interviews from people curious to see what was going on.

"Pack, fly, enjoy/work, fly home, unpack, repeat. Last year, air travel ramped up to 70% of pre-COVID levels globally, and I‚Äôm currently traveling more than I ever have for work. Traveling for work can be incredibly exciting and a nice change of pace when you need it, but it‚Äôs okay to recognize that it is also overwhelming and exhausting. I feel like I‚Äôve gotten so comfortable with my 2023 routine that I quite literally freak out when I have to travel for work. I fear losing the progress I‚Äôve made and breaking the routine that I‚Äôve been so proud of. On the flip side, I‚Äôm happy that I get to see people in person and get out of my room (let‚Äôs be honest, I seriously need to get out of there). Regardless of your views on work travel, here are a few tips on how I overcome travel fatigue and allow myself to enjoy the thrill of a new environment and experience! 1. Think you need 3 days to prep for your trip? Double it, maybe even TRIPLE it. You can never be too prepared when organizing your travels. I always thank myself the day before a trip when I scheduled an appointment or ordered that travel-sized lotion a week prior. 2. Clean your space before you leave. Let‚Äôs face it‚Ä¶ you probably won‚Äôt be in the mood to drop your bags and pull out the clean bedsheets from the dryer when you get back. So just turn on a podcast or music and set aside some time for a deep clean before you head off. 3. Make a list on your phone of last-minute items you need to grab before you leave (chargers, license, coats, snacks for the plane, etc). I seriously doubt your Uber driver is going to be excited to turn around 15 min out from the airport because you forgot your work badge. 4. Not gonna lie‚Ä¶ I get to the airport approximately 15 min early to grab a glass of wine in terminal 2 before boarding‚Ä¶ maybe give it a go next time?

"When I saw LinkedIn ‚Äôs 2023¬†Big Ideas¬†article, I immediately honed in on No. 16 ‚Äì¬†The side hustle will reign supreme.¬†When I began my side hustle of creating paid partnerships via Instagram and TikTok in early 2021, my sole focus was to keep it hidden from my employer. I was ashamed of my side hustle and felt that if my employer found out I‚Äôd get in trouble. I of course did my due diligence on the companies I promoted (ensuring there was no conflict of interest with my employer at the time), but I still always felt like any time I spent on my 5 to 9 would be viewed as me underachieving in my 9 to 5. I‚Äôve now come to learn that Corporate Natalie is something I should be immensely proud of. Making satirical videos about Corporate America allowed me to start my own business, meet incredible business leaders, and build financial stability for myself heading into uncertain economic times. I encourage everyone I meet to try side hustling. While my avenue took the form of content creation, I learn more and more every day about part-time opportunities that don‚Äôt require you to quit your full-time job. What most excited me about the article was David Stillman ‚Äôs take on employers embracing their employees side hustles: ‚ÄúThe workplace needs to embrace them and be like, 'We want to know about your side hustles.

For those of you who don‚Äôt know, Scratchpad is the revenue team workspace that brings your entire sales team together - from sellers to managers to operations to executives - to achieve flawless sales execution, consistent process adherence, and forecasting that actually performs. When we first started working together on TikTok strategies, I told them three things: 1. Get one person (or mascot) to represent the brand. People follow accounts because it becomes a familiar face, voice, and aesthetic. If you have too many cooks in the kitchen, the brand image could get lost. 2. You won‚Äôt go viral in a day. There are a ton of regulatory hurdles that you‚Äôll face as a business account on TikTok - inability to use trending sounds, posts being flagged for unknown reasons, etc. It takes time to make content that meets requirements and has viral potential. 3. Don‚Äôt sell people in every post. A business TikTok account should first grow a following, then sell their product/service. Seeing companies like Duolingo and RyanAir absolutely crush it in the content game, it seems easy enough, right? Truth is, it‚Äôs not. My favorite thing about working on content with Scratchpad is that they‚Äôre willing to take risks, completely open to the possibility of failing, and they have a genuine willingness to try any and all marketing-related ideas.

"This year I had a bit of an awakening during the peak of both my Corporate Natalie career and full-time job. And as the holidays approach, I want to share what `work-life balance` really means to me. About seven months ago, I was working nonstop. During this immensely stressful time, not only was my hair falling out (literally), but I found myself slipping on the core relationships that I hold so near and dear to my heart. I was so heads down in succeeding in my job from 9-5PM, and then pumping out content from 5-9PM, that I forgot to look up and truly be there for the people that I love who were¬†working through their own crucial¬†chapters. I think corporate culture in America normalizes grinding as hard as you can and making your job the most important thing in your life. It was difficult for me to prioritize family and friends when my career was the sole focal point of my life. Last holiday season, you‚Äôd probably find me on my phone posting content during times that I should have been tuned into my family. You‚Äôd see me bringing my laptop to a dinner with friends ‚Äújust in case‚Äù I needed to do something. I‚Äôd probably miss my little cousin coming up to me and telling me about her friends at school. These may have seemed like minor mishaps, but now I look back on those moments and I cringe because I'll never get that precious time back. So that being said, heading into this holiday season I‚Äôm making it a point to unplug and take time to be present with the people around me. Thanks to the support of my friends and family, I was able to resolve this work addiction and adjust my lifestyle to find more balance. However, I want to share this personal reflection of mine so that I can urge you all to keep what is most important to you (outside of work!) top of mind heading into the holidays. These special moments are everything, and I promise, that email can wait!",2y,4100,143,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE
"I still can‚Äôt believe that I made the 2023 Forbes 30 Under 30 list. To think that two years ago I was working 80-hour weeks at a Big 4 consulting firm and am now on this list for my success as a comedic content creator is a feat that I never thought I‚Äôd accomplish. I‚Äôve always known two things about myself: I love making people laugh and I‚Äôm obsessed with entrepreneurship. Growing up in Silicon Valley surrounded by innovators and founders my entire life inspired me to embark on my own ventures from a young age. From opening a car wash company in my parents‚Äô front yard at age 11 (sorry for killing all your plants mom) to founding a jewelry company in college, I always knew I was supposed to build something of my own. Little did I know that this entrepreneurial spirit of mine would drive me to found my own business on social media, where I am so blessed to be able to give back to my community - whether that be advising early-stage companies or consulting incredible creators on how to grow and monetize their own brands. I am so thankful to all of my incredible followers, brand partners, friends, and family for supporting me along the way. I'm immensely thankful to Paycom for giving me the unique opportunity to be in commercials on TV, Dell Technologies for always trusting my organic ad-style, and SoFi for consistently finding new ways to innovate their influencer partnerships program - brand partnerships are vital to the success of content creators, and I'm thankful to every company who has been willing to work with me on creative ways to market their products on social media.

"I had such an incredible time at Duolingo Creator Day last week. Being able to talk with like-minded creators across different social media verticals about the ups and downs of content creation was both beneficial to my creative process and eye opening to learn about different approaches to content/trends/personal branding. Content creation can get lonely sitting in your room filming yourself all day, so being able to dedicate a day to collaboration and creativity was an awesome experience - the Duo-branded converse were a nice touch too ;) Thank you to Zaria Parvez for putting on this event!",2y,1048,14,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE

"A lot of people tell me that they admire what I do as a content creator and wish that they could make TikTok videos too. When I ask, ‚ÄúWell, why don‚Äôt you?‚Äù they‚Äôll respond that they‚Äôre just worried it‚Äôll be ‚ÄúSO cringey‚Äù! And‚Ä¶ I get it, I physically cannot watch videos of myself back and not want to delete the app altogether. But that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not incredibly thankful that I took the risk posting my first video back in 2020. If you want to start posting on social media but you‚Äôre worried about how it‚Äôll be received, I‚Äôd follow this advice: 1. Make content that feels organic and natural to you. I didn‚Äôt just wake up one day and think ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be Corporate Natalie and make TikToks about corporate life.‚Äù I woke up and out of boredom started making a few videos. Try out different things! Maybe it‚Äôs comedy, maybe it‚Äôs a product review of something that‚Äôs changed your life, or maybe it‚Äôs a review of your most recent Hinge date. Whatever it is, make sure you aren‚Äôt forcing it. 2. Keep it clean and don‚Äôt tear people down. I still to this day follow my mom‚Äôs advice that she gave me when I first downloaded Instagram in high school: ‚ÄúMake sure everything you post you‚Äôd be okay with grandma seeing.‚Äù I think it‚Äôs important to note that everything I‚Äôve posted on my channel I‚Äôm comfortable with my employer, strangers on the internet, and of course my grandma seeing. While I make fun of corporate America as a whole, I‚Äôve never targeted specific individuals, companies, or other creators (yes everyone, Bruce is a fictional characterüòÖ). 3. Post. Don‚Äôt let videos sit in your drafts because you‚Äôre too afraid to press post. If I got caught up in how I looked in the videos I‚Äôve made, I‚Äôd have posted 1/100th of the content I‚Äôve shared. It takes courage to have the confidence in yourself to post videos at your rawest form, and take the risk of a video tanking (trust me, nothing burns worse than spending hours on something that completely fails). Keep trying. Keep creating. And most importantly, keep posting. hashtag # contentcreator hashtag # corporate",2y,468,22,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE
"I‚Äôm about to embark on a 2-week trip to Italy that my family had to reschedule from Christmas when a couple of us got COVID (it was me). I literally cannot wait to relax and spend time with the people I love most, but I can‚Äôt help but stress about how much taking time away hurts my business as a content creator. When I take PTO from my corporate job, there‚Äôs a whole crew of people who can step up and get the work done. Responding to one-off texts and emails (while annoying) is completely doable. As a creator, my face is my entire business. When I step away and take a break from making videos, no one can step in and help. I lose followers, my engagement tanks, and in turn I lose brand deals which is currently my sole income source. I know this isn‚Äôt an issue just for me - this affects content creators as a whole. As I continue to grow my business, my main goal is to find ways to cut the unbreakable tie that my face has to Corporate Natalie. It‚Äôs not sustainable to feel this constant remorse and anxiety when stepping away - taking time off allows you to recharge, re-energize, and regain the motivation to create content you‚Äôre proud of.

"Last week I wrote about the new phenomenon of quiet quitting, but equally as important to boosting employees‚Äô stamina and avoiding burnout is quiet management. Quiet managing, a trend Adam Broda is starting (and that I‚Äôll be the first to hop on board with) entails giving employees the choice to work from wherever they want, listening‚Ä¶ actually enacting team feedback, encouraging guilt-free time off, and removing unnecessary distractions. As my social media platforms have grown, so has my team and as a fairly new manager, I want to equip my employees with what they need to be successful and trust them to deliver.

"For those of you who were unable to tune into my episode of LinkedIn Creator Conversations: Using Humor at Work, or who simply don't have the attention span to watch the 38 minute long recording of me telling subpar jokes (trust me‚Ä¶I get it), let me give you a little recap of what we discussed: While I‚Äôve built my brand on corporate humor, I wasn‚Äôt always comfortable using humor in the workplace. I compartmentalized my humor, making it a side of my personality I only showed to friends and family members. At work I was very serious and even fearful of saying the wrong thing. It wasn‚Äôt until about six months into my first job that we went to happy hour with my coworkers after wrapping a big project. Of course, after two margaritas I started cracking jokes and distinctly remember a partner on my team saying, ‚Äúhey you‚Äôre kind of funny!‚Äù While I of course cringed and ensured I didn‚Äôt tell another joke that night for fear of him rescinding that sentiment, this validation gave me the courage I needed to slowly (and carefully) introduce the humorous side of my personality into my work life. So, if you‚Äôve changed your mind and now want to hear Andrew Tarvin and I discuss the benefits (and areas to avoid) of utilizing humor in the workplace, watch the full conversation here:¬†# #",2y,13,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-corporate-natalie-0b634a231?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAADnkvAoB69W0y_4ToD3SzIANnL3LlXg6hTE
"After reading about Apple Together‚Äôs anger towards Apple ‚Äôs new policy (that expects all Bay Area employees to be in office at least three days per week), I took some time to think on it and I couldn‚Äôt agree with them more. My take is that companies offering their employees the flexibility to work from home - or at least the option to work from home - are truly the most productive, and in turn the most successful. And, employees‚Äô excitement towards having the option to choose their work environment will likely reflect in the quality of their work. I know when I get to work from the comfort of my apartment, I often produce the things I‚Äôm most proud of. I also like to throw on a full face of makeup and go into the office once a week - but hey, that‚Äôs just me trying to find the love of my life in my company‚Äôs elevator.

"Quiet quitting, a term I learned on TikTok, is the philosophy of not abruptly leaving a job but starting to quietly scale back on your work load. After graduating from college and scoring my first corporate job I felt like I had to work so hard to prove myself - I wore being the last one in the office on a Friday night like a badge of honor. It took me years to realize no one is watching your Microsoft Team's status to ensure it never says ‚ÄúAway,‚Äù no one cares that you sent an email at 11:30PM, and no one is going to reward you for working until your hair falls out (literally‚Ä¶it was bad). And, I‚Äôm not saying that hard work doesn‚Äôt pay off, but what I have come to realize is balance is much more commendable than putting yourself through torment.
