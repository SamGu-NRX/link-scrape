"I took 2 bags of old clothes to the nearest recycling bin about a mile away.
When I got there, the bin wasn't there.
I had walked 20 minutes in the sweltering sun carrying these heavy bags for nothing.

Then it hit me.
This must be what it's like being poor.
Two giant bags weighing you down.
Making your life harder.

"I caught a thief stealing a package using my home security camera.
The police did nothing.
They said they don't deal with thefts of items with such low value.
What happened to society? I had the thief's face on camera and everything.
I decided to track the thief down myself.
Eventually after several months, I found him.
""I know you stole my trainers.""
The thief panicked. ""Please don't report me to the police.""
""I would never do that,"" I said. ""Instead, I have a job proposal for you. The website I bought the trainers from gave me replacement ones for free. I want to hire you to steal packages from outside my house every week. I will then sell the extra item and we split the profits.""
At first, he was sceptical, but even he could see this was a great offer.
Over the course of years, we made £5,000 in free replacement items together. Not only that, we got close, we bonded.
I gained a lot from this experience. Mainly, over 5 hours of footage of him stealing things from outside my house on a weekly basis.
That was ""high value"" enough for the police to put away this man for years.
When he tried to tell him the truth, they thought he was insane.
Never steal from a man who is willing to do anything for petty revenge.",2d,3206,126,0,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365762234871939072/
"I went to the zoo today. Boring.
Animals are nowhere near as interesting as people, because they don't understand business.
Animals don't set up companies or hire and fire each other.
Animals don't attend conferences and host seminars.
Animals don't make CVs or list their strengths and weaknesses.
Animals don't have zoom meetings or know how to do an effective PowerPoint presentation.
Animals don't have sexual harassment lawsuits.
Animals don't plot and betray each other.
I can get all that amongst my staff.
There is nothing I gain from the zoo. It's for lesser minds who can't understand the nuance of office politics.
Yes, you might catch two animals fucking. But I can easily watch two humans do that too.

If a candidate says they can do a wheelie, I refuse to hire them.

This time it was not by traditional media. It was not by the woke left. Not by the theatre usher for saying ""bloody hell"" during Hamlet.

A year ago my posts were featured on the front page every day. I didn't care that I was labelled a ""lunatic"", many greats were. As long as people saw my wisdom, civilisation was making progress.
At some point, I became too powerful. There were always three or four of my posts at the top.
This led to the invention of ""Satire Saturdays"", which resulted in the deletion of my posts not on a Saturday.

They asked me for my name and ID, and I asked if one of them only tells truths and one of them tells lies.
They had no idea what I was saying and insisted there was only one of them.
“Ah,” I said. “Both of you only tell lies then.”
After 2 hours, my boss came down to sort this out.
She insisted that I was hallucinating, possibly from the undercooked chicken I had this week.
I insisted that she was a vampire because I saw her floating across the lobby.
I told her to “prove it” by standing in front of a mirror. She stood next to the mirror next to the original guard (it was not two guards, he was just next to a mirror.)
I finally arrived at my desk 4 hours into the day, and I was no closer to figuring out what Techchoice does.
All I know is they love the “aaS” acronym as they deal in “UCaaS”, “DRaaS”, “IaaS”, “CCaaS”.

Believe me, I took no pleasure in the kiss.
It was simply good business practice.
I knew it would increase her morale and productivity.
It was clear it would fulfill her Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
Self-actualisation - gives her a sense of purpose
Esteem - the kiss is recognition for her good work
Love and Belonging - intimacy she is missing from her husband
Safety - she felt safe in my arms
Physiological - she would have died if she didn't get to kiss me
I personally hated the kiss, but I thought about the shareholders and powered through.

I was not in a restaurant several weeks ago screaming at a waiter.
I did not tell a waiter to send my dish back because my onions were diced incorrectly.
I did not then proceed to call the waiter a ""beta cuck"" and hurl my chair at him.

I categorically did not shout at the top of my voice ""First it's the onions, then it's our firstborn children.""
I then absolutely did not wet my pants.
This video and all corroborating other videos from different angles were fabricated, no matter how realistic they look.
None of this happened. And even if it had, I would have well been within my right to react this way because onion size is important. But it never happened and I never did these things.

You'd be wrong.
I was actually thinking about my own bowels.
I had eaten a large high fibre breakfast that day and was incredibly bloated.
All I could think about was the motions and noises my body was making downstairs.
But you wouldn't know it.
I have learned to always project an air of authority regardless of what state my intestines are in.
Make sure that any time anyone looks at you, you seem philosophical and pensive.
No matter how gassy you are.

"A candidate showed up very early to a job interview.
How early? 3 months early. Before we even put up the ad.
Him: ""I'm here for the Junior Marketer role.""
Me: ""Err...we aren't hiring.""
Him: ""Not yet. I'm from the future and have travelled back to get a leg up on other applicants.""
I was floored. I couldn't argue with this dedication and hired him on the spot.
After a couple months I suspected him to be a con artist and a compulsive liar and fired him on the spot.
I vowed never to fall for the ""I'm from the future"" trick again.
However, I realised that we actually do need a new Junior Marketer and put out a job ad for it the following Monday.
That Monday was exactly 3 months after that man showed up ""early"".
Wow. I might have fired a real time traveller.

"The cat is out of the bag.
I can announce my appearance as a contestant in the upcoming reality show The Genius Game.
It's a social strategy game show looking to find the UK's biggest geniuses.
I, however, already knew I was a genius so I had nothing to prove.
Instead, I took part for one simple reason:
To show my school bullies that I am no longer a virgin.
In almost every game I play I am constantly slipping in that I am not a virgin.
I do it in very important shots so it is impossible to edit around the fact that I have categorically had sex.
While the other contestants are trying to build alliances and score points, I'll be talking about my many sexual escapades as a definite non-virgin.
If there was any doubt that I am still a virgin in 2025, me saying I am not one will surely clear that up.
Coming soon to ITV1 and ITVX.

I messed up.
I don't know if it was the pressure or just bad luck.
I was tasked with delivering a new brand strategy to a huge client.
Their CEO came in and I was doing the pitch. It was just one slide saying one word:
“LIGMA.”
The client says “What's LIGMA?”
My instincts told me not to say it, but I had already made a whole pitch deck around this.
“Ligma...balls,” I say sheepishly.
He is confused at first, but then starts to smile and says he loves it and wants to hear more
His colleague then pulls him aside to tell him the joke is at his expense and I'm telling him to “lick my balls.”

Simple: buzzwords.
I speak entirely in buzzwords that I don't know what they mean.
Luckily, neither does anyone else.
In my interview they asked me what my big ideas are. I just replied,
“Advertainment. Real time engagement…Phygital.”
I could tell the interviewer didn't know what they meant either, but was too scared to ask.
In fact, I saw him write down “Fidgetal (?)"".

At this point, it became clear she was possessed by a Demon.
Is it possible to overlook a poor interview performance?
I think yes. We should not be so quick to exclude anyone off one nervous interview, so I decided to give her a 6 month trial.
