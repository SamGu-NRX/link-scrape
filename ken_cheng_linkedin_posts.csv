"I took 2 bags of old clothes to the nearest recycling bin about a mile away.When I got there, the bin wasn't there.I had walked 20 minutes in the sweltering sun carrying these heavy bags for nothing.The nearest suitable bin was now 2 miles away.Then it hit me.This must be what it's like being poor.Two giant bags weighing you down.Making your life harder.Everything is slower and tougher.This opened my eyes completely.I dropped the bags then and there right in the street.Why choose to be poor?Simply drop the bags.",Ken Cheng,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"I caught a thief stealing a package using my home security camera.The police did nothing.They said they don't deal with thefts of items with such low value.What happened to society? I had the thief's face on camera and everything.I decided to track the thief down myself.Eventually after several months, I found him.""I know you stole my trainers.""The thief panicked. ""Please don't report me to the police.""""I would never do that,"" I said. ""Instead, I have a job proposal for you. The website I bought the trainers from gave me replacement ones for free. I want to hire you to steal packages from outside my house every week. I will then sell the extra item and we split the profits.""At first, he was sceptical, but even he could see this was a great offer.Over the course of years, we made £5,000 in free replacement items together. Not only that, we got close, we bonded.I gained a lot from this experience. Mainly, over 5 hours of footage of him stealing things from outside my house on a weekly basis.That was ""high value"" enough for the police to put away this man for years.When he tried to tell him the truth, they thought he was insane.Never steal from a man who is willing to do anything for petty revenge.",Ken Cheng,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"I went to the zoo today. Boring.Animals are nowhere near as interesting as people, because they don't understand business.Animals don't set up companies or hire and fire each other.Animals don't attend conferences and host seminars.Animals don't make CVs or list their strengths and weaknesses.Animals don't have zoom meetings or know how to do an effective PowerPoint presentation.Animals don't have sexual harassment lawsuits.Animals don't plot and betray each other.I can get all that amongst my staff.There is nothing I gain from the zoo.

"Bizarre first day atTechChoice.When I arrived at reception, I was greeted by two guards standing in front of two doors, speaking in unison.They asked me for my name and ID, and I asked if one of them only tells truths and one of them tells lies.They had no idea what I was saying and insisted there was only one of them.“Ah,” I said. “Both of you only tell lies then.”After 2 hours, my boss came down to sort this out.She insisted that I was hallucinating, possibly from the undercooked chicken I had this week.I insisted that she was a vampire because I saw her floating across the lobby.I told her to “prove it” by standing in front of a mirror. She stood next to the mirror next to the original guard (it was not two guards, he was just next to a mirror.)I finally arrived at my desk 4 hours into the day, and I was no closer to figuring out what Techchoice does.All I know is they love the “aaS” acronym as they deal in “UCaaS”, “DRaaS”, “IaaS”, “CCaaS”.I tried to make a joke out of this and said “I’m an aaS-man too”, but it got no laughs because I was talking to a plant.My boss said I should go home because I clearly had food poisoning.Jokes on her as I had done shrooms that morning.TechChoiceis an amazing company that may or may not specialise in buttstuff.",Ken Cheng,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc

How can I expect to run a business properly if my workers won't put aside their values on human rights to do exactly what I say at all times?Gen Z are just not cut out for the workplace.",Ken Cheng,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc

It just so happens that these are all men who also went on my stag do.While I fully support the push for greater diversity in the workplace, the current ratio of male to female persons with the name John makes this very difficult.

Still, I hope she learned something from this.",Ken Cheng,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc

"I bought a burial spot for my first startup company.When my first company was declared bankrupt, I held a funeral procession for it and placed an effegy of it into a casket, which got lowered into the ground. Very few people came to this.Every year now I visit the grave to leave flowers and tell it how much it taught me about business.This year there was an elderly woman also visiting her husband's grave, whom she was married to for 50 years.Her story was touching and all, but her husband was just one man, whereas my company employed 12 people and in a way, they all died when the company went under.When I told her about my lost loved one, she burst into tears.""Losing Ernest was hard but it is nothing compared to what you and the world lost when Cartocopies folded. You are very brave.""She got it in a way no one else did.It's a shame people don't value the lives of companies as much as actual humans, just because they don't have sentience, feelings or any physical form.RIP Cartocopies Jun 31st 2008 - Sep 1st 2009",Ken Cheng,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"Several years ago a previous girlfriend caught me using Tinder on my phone and was very mad.She had no right to be.This is equivalent to looking at a job advert while you're currently employed.If an employer told you that you can't do that, that would be illegal. If they checked your phone like she did, that's a breach of my privacy.She said she was trying to check the weather and saw the notification which is several nude photos.I quoted that any evidence obtained unlawfully is inadmissable in court. She said ""THIS is inadmissable in court"" and threw my phone out the window, which I found immature.You are legally allowed to interview for other companies even if you have a perfectly good job, just like I am legally allowed to solicit buttpics even if I have a perfectly good butt at home.Ultimately a relationship is a lot like business in which you have to adhere to the explicit terms of the contract and the law.

"My wife made me sleep in the car for a week. It taught me a lot about resilience, culpability and imperfection.We had a huge argument because I accidentally locked her out of the house by leaving the keys in the front door.She banged on the door for hours but I was playing Call of Duty with headphones in.When she eventually climbed through the slightly open kitchen window, she was livid.I understood her anger even though there was nothing anyone could have done to avoid this.Everyone makes mistakes in business and in marriage. She seemed unable to accept this.I told her ""worst comes to worst, you could've slept in the car."" My solutions based  mindset seemed to make her more angry.She said sleeping in the car is horrific and I replied that it isn't, and I could do it for a whole week if I had to, so that's what I did.When I came back, she was still angry even though a) I showed her I was able to accept penance and b) I was completely right about the car thing.Sometimes, like in business, a relationship just doesn't see eye to eye.

"Mike was planning to propose to Jenny just before end of play last Friday in the office.They met 4 years ago working here when their desks were opposite each other and their love blossomed.He asked me to help out - he wanted elaborate music, and loads of fanfare, with a  big banner coming down from the ceiling.

"Sometimes at the end of a meeting at work, it's hard to tell when you should lean in for a kiss.I find business meetings very intimate and intense, whether it's a job interview, a performance review or an external client. This naturally leads to wanting to kiss.However, I know too well that leaning in and making them feel uncomfortable is disastrous.That's why I've invented the ""I Don't Want To Be Kissed"" Badge.There's a tray at the front desk that people can take them from and wear throughout the day to avoid me trying to kiss them. This should make them feel 100% safe at work.Since I introduced them, almost every single employee has started using them, especially the women. That's when you know it was a good idea.Thanks to this one simple trick, not a single person has been kissed in my office that didn't want to be.Workplace sexual harassers hate me.",Ken Cheng,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc

"How do you fairly slice a cake?It was Martha's birthday in the office and someone brought a cake.However, if we did it equally between everyone, all 45 of us would get a tiny amount.I brainstormed. I considered that we do it by salary, but this seemed unfair as I would get the most cake.That's when it hit me: we should do it by how much people had contributed to the cake eating process itself.Sean got 25% for baking the cake.Sally got 12.5% for going to the kitchen to get the knife.Ben got 12.5% for transporting the cake to the office.And I got 50% for taking charge of the distribution process, R&Ding how we could cut the cake, and managing everyone.Marsha got absolutely nothing as she didn't even know about the cake's existence until it was in front of her.Without me stepping in and leading the situation, everyone would've been sitting around not eating cake.

"I sometimes play Werewolf with my co-workers.2 werewolves, 5 villagers. The werewolves have to avoid detection while the villagers must find the werewolves.I came up with an unbeatable strategy. The werewolf is trying to act as a villager, so I immediately come out and say I am a werewolf when I'm a villager, because a werewolf would never do that.It is a brilliant strategy that follows foolproof logic, even though everyone always executes me for doing this because they are logicless idiots.I've been applying this practice to the business world.For example, I once interviewed a candidate and they said ""I am terrible at my job."" I hired him on the spot.Why? Someone terrible at their job would be lying about being good at their job, so I surmised they must be good at their job. Perfect logic.He did turn out to be terrible at his job though and I fired him after 3 months for leaking all our customers' passwords, but the logic itself was still sound.You miss 100% of the terrible candidates you don't hire.",Ken Cheng,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc

"I was hiring for a very integral position at my company. I was down to only two candidates.They were equally qualified, both gave equally good interviews. It was impossible to decide between them. That's when I had a genius idea and called both back in.I decided to smell them.I can deduce a lot from smelling someone - it's like a sixth sense to me.For example, when I sniffed the first candidate, I got a sense he lived in an affluent neighborhood. His coffee breath smelled like the upmarket stuff rather than a chain, and there was a strong artisan bakery scent. There was a whiff of grease oil so I knew he didn't mind getting his hands dirty.He smelled good at his job.I then brought in the second candidate. When I leaned in to smell him, he freaked out. He screamed ""what are you doing"" and had to leave.I knew immediately he wasn't right for this position. What a shame, but sometimes you just know it's not going to work.We hired the first candidate.

Let me tell you, it is NEVER the manager's fault.England lost for one reason alone:The players did not invest enough money crypto.I went to Phil Foden and offered him a great deal on my new cryptocurrency. He outright refused. I said how about this: if I can do more keepie-uppies than you, you must invest in my crypto. Not only did I do more keepie-uppies, I was still going for 15 minutes after him, and he begged me to stop because he was bored and wanted to get an ice lolly.""Okay,"" I said, ""now you have to get some of my new coin.""He said ""sorry I have to go to practice"" and just left. I never heard from him again.Had he invested in my coin, he would've made 20x his money back and had more confidence in the match last night.The fault of any football match loss rests squarely on the football employees.

"You are never truly alone or without friends in the modern world. Here's why.One night I was feeling lonely as all my friends were busy and I wanted to hang out. So I decided to wander the streets alone.While I was out, I noticed a sign that was advertising Sky TV's True Detective. It reminded me how a friend also suggested this show. That's when it hit me.Billboards are your friends too. Think about it. What are friends for, but to suggest things for you to enrich your own life with? In fact, adverts can do that job even better because they have a graphic design budget behind them.You don't need friends anymore as long as advertising exists. Your true friends? Corporate marketing.I went home and watched True Detective on my own and it was alright.",Ken Cheng,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
"You have to be prepared to make cuts.Sometimes you cannot afford to pay all your workers. Sometimes a worker is being incompetent and lousy.Last Summer, I had a team of 5 employees. Four were doing amazingly, producing great work constantly and always making the effort. The last was slacking, late for all their appointments and being generally bad vibes.News came that our budget was slashed 20%. It came to a tough decision, but I had to let the underperfoming employee leave. I told them to pack their things and go - they no longer had my support.This story is actually about my five children. The youngest, then 16, was forced to move out as they were failing their GCSEs.Interestingly, people always think the story is fine when I tell it about my employees, but not okay when it's about my children.

"I'm a very big proponent of boycotts. They are incredibly important and I will lay down my life for a cause. However I also really enjoy Eurovision.That's when I came up with an ingenious idea: boycott offsetting. If I can convince two friends to boycott it, I can still watch it guilt free and still be net +1 boycott.No one would bite. I then offered to pay two strangers £200 each, but most people thought it was a scam. That's when I knew I was ahead of my time.Suddenly, a brain wave. I had access to a whole load of employees I had direct power over and could manipulate without consequence.I found out casually who would be watching the show during the week. I then invented a fake deadline that meant two of them had to work Saturday between 8pm - 12am (I convinced them it was our Sydney clients because of the timezone). I then blocked BBC iPlayer in the office so they could not catch a glimpse of it.Voila, boycott offsetting completed.

"Anger is a healthy and ok emotion.That's why every time anything goes wrong in my life, I go to the designated ""Anger Room"" in my office building.It's a completely safe space to scream whatever obscenities you want, destroy expensive objects and release your animal urges.I go there after any setback, like whenever my stocks dip more than 2% or I've lost a game of Super Auto Pets.Letting off steam is very important for productivity, which is why I go there, shout ""you f******* C***"" for 5 minutes straight then smash up the PC in there with a baseball bat. I do this twice an hour, which is normal and healthy.The only downside is this Anger Room is still being used as Steve's office, my head of HR.

"I was watching Physical 100 with my partner, where 100 top athletes compete in tough physical challenges.The contestants accomplished impressive feats but there were too many tasks focussed on raw body strength, and no tasks that tested the physical endurance needed to be an impressive CEO of a large company.My partner kept commenting how they were very attractive but how did she know, when she hasn't seen them in a business environment?After all, being able to do weighted squats lifting 250kg would get you nowhere in a board meeting with investors or while negotiating a merger.Had I been on Physical 100, I would have an advantage that very few of them had: lots of money. I can pay an athlete to push a minecart with 1.5 tons of weights, but very few athletes could 100m hurdle their way into a Fortune 500 company.So, in many ways, the true winner of Physical 100 would be an entrepreneur.

Have you seen the Hunger Games? It's like that, because they're also not allowed any food and get very hungry. It is gruelling and lasts 12 hours, and the loser goes home unemployed.

"Just reading about the rise of the ""sheconomy"" which is a clever cross between the words ""she"" and ""autonomy"". But what is fuelling this rise?Brands expect that by 2028, women will account for 75% of discretionary spending. That means that at this rate, by 2038, women will account for over 144% of discretionary spending! This is worrying as men will be -44%, and women must grow 1.4 in size to account for this demand.But what explains this change? Let's look at my own workplace practices.I'm a big practiser of ""shequality"" which a clever cross between the words ""she"" and ""quality"".A few years ago I read about this concept called ""impostor syndrome"" which told me that all women must feel like impostors all the time. That's why I make sure women are given very important leadership roles and high pay even if they aren't qualified, so they can truly be an impostor.Under my leadership, I make sure women are always at the top of the ladder (although they must stay one rung below me because I'm CEO).Men on the other hand must be treated like the worms they are.A few years ago I read about this concept called ""mansplaining"" which is a clever cross between the words ""man"" and ""plain"", which is that men are really plain and boring whenever they open their mouth. That's why I refuse to listen to any man, in any situation.So how did women get so empowered and rich? Simple. The actions of great men like myself.Be like me.

But no, I held out my palm and calmly said ""Let me have my sweater, and I will let you have 3% of the these that I find.""I showed it a small sack of fish eggs. The snake relented and let me have my backpack back. I essentially sold it a stock option.Someone who was watching approached me and said: “That snake bit you. Why are you still trying to help it?”I replied: “The nature of the snake is to bite, but that's not going to change my nature, which is to make very good business deals.”Do not change your nature simply because someone harms you.

"Let me tell you what I think is the most oppressed group in business: people who work in internal comms.Sure it doesn't have the pizazz of PR or the incredibly high sex appeal of marketing, but people who work in IC are human beings too.Meet Helen, she worked in IC at my old company.

Write an internal newsletter about it?"" the man continued. ""IC prick!""Then he got the others at the table to chant ""IC! IC! IC! IC someone without any career advancement options!"" which was hard to coordinate but still hurtful.Helen ran away crying. It should not have happened. Especially because the man who started chanting was me. I'm sorry Helen.I was a different person back then, blind to my own biases. The truth is the bullying people in IC receive is worse than any discrimination, or hate speech.And I didn't realise that, not until September 2014 when I received an internal newsletter that said someone at the company was willing to donate a kidney to someone who needed it.My son needed a kidney then.

"My 7 year-old daughter did the dishes last night, and picked up the cat poo in the garden. After she finished she asked me for ""overtime pay"".At first I was taken aback, but eventually I was happy to give it to her because it showed assertiveness.I offered her £5 per dish she washed and £10 per poo of cat she picked up, a lowly wage to not spoil my child.However, she began feeding our cat laxatives so he'd poo more, and our garden was constantly filled with it.She was now working non stop to clean dishes and pick up cat poo. She was so tired, breaking down into tears that I considered cutting her off, but it was an important lesson in the dangers of overtime pay.Eventually she started screaming that I need to take away her ""overtime pay"", which I did and now she is back to happily cleaning the dishes for free.I won.This is why being paid more can actually be negative, and why my employees only get half pay for working overtime and I refuse any pay rise.

"We had a clap for the workers for the NHS two years ago who are, of course, heroes. Anyone who knows me will know I am the first to admit that. They are courageous and very important to our economy.But do you know who else is important? People who work in marketing.Without them, we would not know how to buy things we want, whether it's the latest smartphone or a head of lettuce at your local grocer's.And yet, there is no clap for marketing executives, like myself. Instead, I often get sneery remarks and weird looks when I mention how I'm a top level CEO of a marketing firm at the ASDA checkout.This is a form of PREJUDICE.

"We used to have a VIP Bathroom in our office, but it hit me. VIP stands for ""Very Important Person"", but every single person who works in my company is very important, to me. That's why we made all bathrooms VIP bathrooms that can be used by all employees.However, the old VIP bathroom is much larger and nicer and has a better scent than the other bathrooms and too many people were using it over the other bathrooms.So, we decided to make it an EIP-only bathroom, where three of our VIPs will also be EIPs.

"A very clever thing in our applicant test for joining our company is at the end of the questions we ask them to predict their result.One man, Candidate A we'll call him (not his real name) scored 70℅ but predicted he got 98% at the end, which was a vast overestimation.A woman, Candidate B (no relation) only got 66%, but she predicted she got about 58%, a slight underestimation. A worse result but a more accurate self-assessment.Who did I hire? Neither. A third candidate, Candidate C achieved a score of 10%, a score he then predicted dead on.I think the most important facet above all else is knowing your own ability, more important than competency, showing up on time and not doing drugs in the office toilets.

"Next time your boss tells you ""you're fired"" don't say ""you can't fire me, I quit"". Many employees have done this when I have fired them and it hurts my feelings every time. It is simply mean.After all, imagine if your wife said to you that she wants a divorce and you said ""you can't divorce me, I quit"". Well, that's what I said when mine told me in a Zizzi's. She was visibly upset and that's when I learned  it is harder to be the breaker-upper than the breakee-uppee.The same is true for firing whether it's an unfair dismissal or not. It hurts me more to fire someone to their face than it does to be fired, which is often why I do it via a public Slack chat. Like if you have to put a wounded deer out of its misery, the deer's death is instant, but I have to live with the guilt. My employees are the deer.So have some sympathy for your boss which has to make the hard decisions. When they fire you, simply tell them that there are no hard feelings, thanks for the opportunities and they are a very brave boss.

"My 7 year-old daughter came home from school and told me that a man told her to ""smile"" today. Normally I would have called the police and had him arrested but she had it covered.She stood up to him and said ""actually telling women to smile is sexist and upholds a patriarchal society that wants to control us, so you should stop.""The man burst into tears. ""I'm not a sexist!"" He exclaimed. ""I'm just doing my job as the school photographer."" Flimsy excuses.She then mobilised the other girls in her class to support her, along with some of the boys too. They signed an e-petition that got 3,000 signatures and that was just from members of their class.The photographer was fired and girls were now banned from smiling in photos, and boys were forced to smile under punishment of exclusion, to know what it was like to live in a society which pressures you into smiling.Later, as she was walking home, she spotted the photographer packing his tripod into the back of his car. She was worried he would be angry so tried to avoid him, but he stopped her.""Thank you, wise child"" he said, tearfully. ""Because of you I am quitting my misogynist job and going back to university. I'm going to retrain as a feminist ally.""""No, thank you."" She said, magnanimously, and smiled. As was her choice.

"I attended a virtual conference with other managers and the main focus was on whether it's important to treat your employees like human beings.The person speaking before me made the point that you are paying then so that shows you care way more than things like remembering their name or saying hello to them when they come into your office.A compelling point but when I took the floor, I told everyone that I make sure to have a full conversation with everyone I hire. Everyone's jaws dropped as if I had claimed unions were a good thing or managers don't need to have a business degree.I told them a story about how I sat down with my new employee Jacob and asked him to tell me about his family. He opened up quickly and told me how he took care of his three children and mother. I told him it was very similar to how I take care of my children aka my company. We bonded.Later, we were negotiating his new contract. Luckily using the knowledge from our DMC, I could leverage my position into a better contract for me, knowing he couldn't risk unemployment.

"An employer/employee relationship is much like a marriage. However, it is also unlike a marriage in the sense that a boss should not expect their workers to cook for them, especially if it's the exact beef lasagne my wife does. I learned this the hard way, when I asked Brian to do this, and when he refused, I was upset and asked if this meant he no longer liked me. He found this exchange very awkward and handed in his notice, which at the time, felt very much like a divorce. I grew from this though, and learned to never get close to my employees, which meant no more backrubs from my personal assistant, and also I ended several affairs.I also found out that it applies the other way - you shouldn't expect your wife to answer your phone calls or manage your diary, no matter how high a salary you offer her.

"Here's a learning experience. My eldest son who is now 21 came up to me in 2007 (he was only 7 at the time). He said ""Daddy, Daddy, I have a business idea!"" He explained it to me and it sounded like utter nonsense at the time, so I sent him to his room without supper for wasting my time during work hours.The business idea he described was, almost word-for-word, the description of blockchain technology, aka bitcoin. Of course he didn't call it bitcoin, he called it ""shadow sauce"", but it was otherwise the exact idea behind cryptocurrency.""Shadow sauce would be a decentralised digital currency!"" My 7-year old insisted. I scoffed, and mocked him until he cried. That would never happen today, because he is now 21 and he's learned to suppress his emotions to get ahead in business.The irony is, spoiler alert, that cryptocurrency took off in a big way and I would be a trillionaire by now if only I had listened to the boy. To think, all this time I thought my son was dumb, but really, *I* was the dumb one.

"Hello everyone. I was just visiting a farm in the Hertfordshire countryside and it made me think: what is it about the simplicity of a goat that can help me make my business 15% more efficient?Start with the horns. The horns are me hiring a very strong law department to defeat anyone who will sue my company for sidestepping trading regulations, environmental safety or the Geneva Convention. Only a goat could do help me think of that.Take the way a goat runs. That is exploiting tax loopholes, of course. A greatly pleasing measure that only evolutionary biology could've come up with.Now when I go to feed the goat, it bites my hand, but if I tie it's mouth up with some very strong rope, not only can it not bite me but it has to eat anything I feed it. This is removing any employment rights and extra benefits from all my employees. Wonderful idea that could only be inspired by the accidental ingenuity of nature.This is free advice for any of those looking to get ahead in entrepreneurism.

"My 5-year old son was acting up in the car on the way to Southampton so I did the only thing I could: I decided to cancel my child.There is no better punishment for your children in the 21st Century than putting a black mark against their reputation for years to come. I got a Twitter hashtag goinghashtag#cancelbrian, and I went to his school and told his classmates what he'd done. They now saw him for the scourge that he was and he was cast out from most social circles.Brian felt very bad about this, as he should, and he apologised. Unfortunately, the apology wasn't remotely sufficient: he blamed his ""younger sister"", ""the ambient temperature of the car"" and ""the fact we didn't have time to buy him lunch"" instead of focusing on his own shortcomings. It was clear he hadn't learned. As a result, he'll be stepping back from public life and his front-seat privileges will be revoked.He now never steps out of line, very quiet and living in a constant paranoia that his tarnished reputation will be dragged under the limelight. One day, I hope he will find it within himself to reach the maturity expected of him in public society, and we can finally bring ourselves to forgive Brian. Until then, I will enjoy the peace and quiet. Cancelling my son was the best thing we've ever done.",Ken Cheng,0,0,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-cheng-991849b6?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABivhj0By6q1ONB6QeqR4XBHHsD0L3A9vLc
